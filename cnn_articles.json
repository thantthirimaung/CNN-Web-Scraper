        "content": "CNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            Messing up pronunciations can be a source of both annoyance and amusement, but language learning platform Babbel has put together a handy guide to stop you putting your foot in it.\n    \n\n            The company published a list of the most mispronounced words of the year in the United States and the United Kingdom on Wednesday, including foreign words that have entered the English lexicon for one reason or another, as well as the names of various politicians and public figures.\n    \n\n            US Vice President Kamala Harris is one prominent entry, with her first name the source of plenty of confusion. It should be pronounced COM-a-la, according to Babbel.\n    \n\n            One name that features on both the US and UK lists is award-winning Irish actor Barry Keoghan. “His name is pronounced (key-OH-gin), with a clear “g,” unlike many Irish variations where the “g” would be silent,” said Babbel.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's Barry key-OH-gin.\n\nMichael Tran/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            Another dual entry is fast-fashion firm Shein. Founded in China, the company has grown massively. If you’re discussing potential purchases, or reports that the company plans to list on the London Stock Exchange, remember that the name should be pronounced (SHE-in) rather than (SHEEN).\n\n\n            Other notable entrants include semaglutide, an active ingredient in weight loss drug Ozempic, pronounced (sem-ah-GLOO-tide); rising music star Chappell Roan (CHAP-uhl ROHN); and US actress Zendaya (zen-DAY-uh).\n    \n\n            The Swedish language also contributes two words on the UK list: smokeless tobacco Snus, pronounced (SNOOZ), and flygskam, the name of a movement that aims to discourage people from flying that should be pronounced (FLEEG-skam).\n    \n\n            Italian readers will also appreciate the inclusion of the word espresso on the list.\n    \n\n            While many British people commonly mispronounce it when ordering a small black coffee, crimes against the Italian language spiked this summer when Sabrina Carpenter’s single “Espresso” topped the UK charts.\n    \n\n            Remember, it’s (es-PRESS-oh) not (EX-press-oh).",

        "title": "Rules, origins and effects: MLB’s controversial Golden At-Bat proposal, explained",
        "content": "CNN\n         — \n    \n\n\nLeBron James making a buzzer-beater to win the game. Patrick Mahomes scanning the field with seconds remaining. Lionel Messi standing over a free kick in stoppage time.\n    \n\n            Most team sports allow their biggest stars to take over in the most important moments – the ones when you just have to get it right.\n    \n\n            Not baseball. It doesn’t matter whether it’s the first inning or the ninth, whether you’re up by 10 or down by one. You could be Aaron Judge or a struggling rookie, but – save for pinch hitters – if you’re up next, you’re up next.\n    \n\n            But, after MLB commissioner Rob Manfred controversially floated the idea of a Golden At-Bat rule in October, all that might be about to change.\n    \n\n        What is a Golden At-Bat?\n\n\n            Manfred’s idea is simple. Once a game, a coach can choose to sit down whoever is on deck, and instead send any batter of his choosing to the plate.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred speaks at a press conference following an owners meeting on May 23.\n\nJulia Nikhinson/AP\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\n‘Why do we want to bastardize our game?’: MLB players and managers join criticism of Golden At-Bat proposal\n\n\n\n\n            It is unclear yet how the details of the proposal – which according to Manfred was “in the conversation-only stage right now” in October – would work.\n    \n\n            Potential wrinkles to the rule could include an option where only the team that is trailing in the ninth inning can use a Golden At-Bat, or where teams can only use it in the seventh inning or later.\n    \n\n            It is also unknown whether there would be any restrictions on who you are allowed to summon to the plate. If, for example, Toronto Blue Jays first baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hits a double, can he then go back to the plate and hit again in a Golden At-Bat? And if he can, who would replace him at second base?\n    \n\n            These are all questions that will have to be answered if the proposal goes any further.\n    \n\n        Will the Golden At-Bat rule definitely be introduced?\n\n\n            In short, no. Given how early in its development the rule is, there is absolutely no guarantee that the concept will move beyond the ideas stage.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor League Baseball (MLB) will test the use of robot umpires as part of a challenge system during spring training next year with the aim of implementing it in the 2026 regular season.\n\nEzra Shaw/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nMLB to test robot umpires as part of challenge system at next Spring training, plans use in 2026 regular season\n\n\n\n\n            However, it is looking more and more likely that the Golden At-Bat will be tested away from the MLB. According to The Athletic, those involved in the minor leagues have heard “buzz” that the league is interested in trialing the rule over the next two years.\n    \n\n            The MLB All-Star Game has also been suggested as a potential testing ground for the rule.\n    \n\n            Speaking on The Varsity with John Ourand, Manfred said: “Most of the changes we have discussed involve producing the matchups, in the context of an exhibition game, that the fans want to see the most. You know, more freedom in terms of substitution and whatnot. I am receptive to those ideas, in the context of an exhibition game.”\n    \n\n            While not speaking specifically about the Golden At-Bat or the All-Star Game, it is not hard to see why many have reached the conclusion that Manfred would like to see the concept play out in the Midsummer Classic.\n    \n\n        Where did the idea originate?\n\n\n            While Manfred has caused quite a stir in mentioning the rule, the idea of a Golden At-Bat has been around for years.\n    \n\n            Former Miami Marlins president David Samson says that he informally pitched the idea a decade ago, when he was a member of MLB’s previous version of its committee.\n    \n\n            “The view was, you are basically ruining the sanctity of the game,” he told The Athletic. “The brilliance of the history of the game is that, hey, if the right guy’s up, the right guy’s up – and if not, he’s not.”\n    \n\n            It should perhaps come as no surprise that the proposal has come back into discussion now. Manfred has developed a reputation as a tinkerer, having introduced the generally popular pitch clock and the generally unpopular ghost runner rule, which automatically places a runner on second base at the start of each extra inning in regular-season games.\n    \n\n        How would it change the game?\n\n\n            The introduction of a Golden At-Bat rule – at least without very strict limitations on how and when teams could use it – would fundamentally change the sport in any number of ways.\n    \n\n            We would likely see a significant boost in the best players’ stats. Players like Shohei Ohtani could potentially have an extra 120 at-bats per season, most of which would come with the opportunity to bring home runners.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen St. Louis Cardinals third baseman David Freese celebrates his game-winning home run in the 11th inning of Game 6 the World Series on October 27, 2011.\n\nJeff Haynes/Reuters\n\n\n\n            It is therefore likely that, pretty quickly, the league would see new records for RBIs, home runs and various other stats.\n    \n\n            Conversely, it would also likely mean a decline in the stats for the league’s relief pitchers, who would suddenly be facing much higher caliber batters far more often.\n    \n\n            As pointed out by Philadelphia Phillies reliever Matt Strahm when speaking to The Athletic, “Say you have a guy like Craig Kimbrel, who is going to be chasing 500 saves. Then he’s got to do it at the end of his career against Aaron Judge and Juan Soto for every save?”\n    \n\n            On top of that, the rule would likely see a reduction in moments when unfancied batters shock the world by pulling a clutch moment out of nowhere.\n    \n\n            David Freese’s game-tying triple for the St. Louis Cardinals in the ninth inning of Game 6 of the 2011 World Series – which he followed up with a walk-off home run – saw him become World Series MVP that year.\n    \n\n            But, given he was 0-for-3 in the game before then, would he really have had the chance to swing the bat if the Cardinals could have swapped him out for star Albert Pujols?\n    \n\n        How have current and former players and managers reacted?\n\n\n            It is “what if?” discussions like these that have driven the largely negative reception that the proposal has received from players and managers.\n    \n\n            “Not all change is great,” wrote former Red Sox first baseman Kevin Youkilis on X. “The best part of baseball is when the guy least expected to get the big hit delivers at the end of the game. A memory that lasts a lifetime for the player and fans.\n    \n\n            “The roller coaster ride of emotions in sports is what makes it the best unscripted entertainment.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Boston Red Sox first baseman Kevin Youkilis is one of a number of players, past and present, to voice their opposition to the rule.\n\nGregory Shamus/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            “Our game is not built that way,” Joe Maddon – former manager of the Tampa Bay Rays, Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Angels – told The Athletic. “Why do we want to bastardize our game and make it like everybody else?\n    \n\n            “The more we see things, the less impact they have,” he continued. “The Trout-Ohtani thing (the final at-bat in the 2023 WBC Championship) was outstanding because you rarely see it. You don’t see Halley’s Comet every night.”\n    \n\n            That might very well be true, but one thing is for sure – if the Golden At-Bat rule does come into effect, you might not be seeing more comets in the sky. But you will be seeing a lot more of the stars on the field.",

Van Dyke is in top form in the project – dancing barefoot, singing alongside Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, and even performing some physical comedy.\n    \n\n            Filmed at Van Dyke’s Malibu, California home, the video is interspersed with old photographs and props from the beloved entertainer’s seven-decade career, including publicity stills alongside Mary Tyler Moore for “The Dick Van Dyke Show” and one of his four Primetime Emmy statuettes.\n    \n\n            At one point, Van Dyke remarks that his favorite lyrics in “All My Love” – off of Coldplay’s tenth studio album “Moon Music” – are “Until I die, let me hold you if you cry.” In an interview, he shares, “I’m acutely aware that I could go any day now, but I don’t know why, it doesn’t concern me, I’m not afraid of it. I have that feeling, totally against anything intellectual, that I’m going to be alright.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDick Van Dyke and Arlene Silver.\n\nAtlantic Music Group\n\n\n\n            Van Dyke is then seen on the dance floor alongside his wife, makeup artist Arlene Silver, as they engage in choreography while wearing matching bowler hats before the rest of his “big family” join them for picture-taking and camaraderie.\n    \n\n            The funnyman also displays that he still has his sharp sense of humor, when the interviewer asks him to close his eyes and think about all the people that have meant something to him over the course of his life. After a beat with his eyes closed, Van Dyke says, “I’m too old for this, I’ll pass out and go to sleep” as he play-acts nodding off in his chair.\n    \n\n            Elsewhere, the “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang” actor holds a bunch of red balloons and pretends, quite convincingly for a moment, to float away.\n    \n\n            “I think I’m one of those lucky people who got to do for a living what I would have done anyway,” Van Dyke remarks in the clip, as scenes from his screen career play. “When you think how lucky I am – I got to do what I do, play and act silly.”\n    \n\n            A shorter version of the music video will be released on Friday, December 13, to mark the occasion of Van Dyke’s 99th birthday.",

        "content": "CNN\n         — \n    \n\n\nGet inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple. Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being.\n\n\n            Shortly after Nattie Powell’s daughter turned 1 year old, Powell bought her a toddler-sized Christmas tree toy just in time for the 2023 holiday season.\n    \n\n            The tree was bright green with different colored plastic ornaments, topped with a fluorescent yellow star.\n    \n\n            Powell, who often records herself DIYing various holiday decor and household objects, thought painting the tree neutral colors would better suit the aesthetic of her living room. But once she posted the updated toy — dark green with brown ornaments — commenters quickly called her out on a “beige mom” activity.\n    \n\n            “We have so many toys that are bright and colorful as parents and as moms, and sometimes it can be really overstimulating at the end of the day,” Powell said. “I wanted to have just one neutral toy that may blend in with aesthetics, especially if we’re keeping it out for a couple months for the holiday season.”\n    \n\n            Powell had not anticipated how passionately people would respond to the video, calling her a “beige mom,” and a “sad beige mom.” It’s a term that started trending in 2023 to criticize mothers who decorate their houses and children’s rooms in beige tones and purchase colorless toys and clothing.\n    \n\n            While the parents are often criticized for their choices in neutral tones, experts say the colors don’t matter as long as there is variety and diversity in other areas of the child’s life.\n    \n\n        It is OK to be a ‘beige mom’\n\n\n            Powell’s daughter didn’t seem to care, playing with the toy tree without complaint, she said.\n    \n\n            “Viewers don’t always see what is going behind the scenes,” Powell said. “So many people saw the sad beige Christmas tree, but they didn’t see the thousands of other colorful toys that are stuffed in cabinets or in my daughter’s room.”\n    \n\n            The ‘beige mom’ term has been tossed around to describe many parents’ situations, including those who prefer colorless toys, like to dress their babies in neutrals or maintain muted nurseries — and certain celebrities have also been granted the descriptor.\n    \n\n            But what matters more than the colors of the rooms or toys, is the relationship between the caregiver and child and how they interact with the objects together, said Dr. Roberta Golinkoff, the Unidel H. Rodney Sharp Professor of education, psychology and linguistics at the University of Delaware.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung blonde woman sitting next to the Christmas tree, looking for something on her phone. Wearing a red christmas sweater.\n\nZiga Plahutar/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nA phone may be a magical gift for your child, and these rules can keep it from turning into a bad move\n\n\n\n\n            “People are entitled to decorate their house any way they like — pink, blue, beige,” Golinkoff said. “There is no way in which this is going to harm a kid, no way, because the kid sees all kinds of color outside. … organically.”\n    \n\n            Colors don’t even matter at first because infants can’t fully see color until a few months of age, so newborns tend to be more attracted to objects that have high contrast, such as black and white or other variations of lighter colors in contrast to darker colors, said Dr. Jennifer Poon, a professor of pediatrics at the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University and a developmental-behavioral pediatrician.\n    \n\n            As the child gets older, that’s when guardians can begin to see if their children have their own preferences, and that might be when a parent would want to find balance between their own aesthetics and their child’s wishes, Golinkoff said. For younger children at a few years of age, having more color can equate to more learning opportunities, such as pointing out if an object is blue or yellow, but as a child gets older, the conversations can expand to how they feel about different colors.\n    \n\n            “It just gives you more opportunity for conversation if you have color in the kid’s life,” Golinkoff said, who also advised to be cautious when painting children’s toys, as some paints can be toxic for small children who often put toys in their mouths.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKindergarten classroom\n\nMint Images RF/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nYour kid’s teachers are not the enemy. How to handle the parent-teacher conference\n\n\n\n\n        Interactions between parents and children\n\n\n            Parents or guardians who choose colors or aesthetics they enjoy might encourage more baby and caregiver interactions, which is most important for the baby’s development, said Dr. Tricia Skoler, an expert in infant brain and behavioral development and a psychology professor at Hunter College of the City University of New York.\n    \n\n            “We know that being engaged with another person is going to improve babies’ learning and communication. So, one way to get babies and adults engaged and interacting is to create environments that both of them like. … And not to create environments where the kids are in one bright corner doing whatever and then the adults are somewhere else,” Skoler said.\n    \n\n            Babies do need to see and interact with various colors, but more importantly they need diversity in their environment, which includes different textures and temperatures to interact with, she said. Having variety can make the environment more interesting and encourages more interactions between babies and caregivers to explore and learn about their surroundings together, she added.\n    \n\n            “Mothers shouldn’t feel judged or stressed out about if they choose to embrace the ‘beige mom’ trend or not,” said Poon, who is also the chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ section on developmental and behavioral pediatrics.\n    \n\n            “Rather, we want mothers to feel freedom where they know that their child’s development really is more contingent upon their relational development, not necessarily materialistic objects. … Playing, talking, having experiences together, those are the things that are really important for child development.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA young boy getting frustrated with technology\n\nToni Faint/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nParents are worried that their anger might be influencing their children. Here’s what experts say\n\n\n\n\n            Now that her daughter is 2 years old, Powell has started a tradition where she lets her daughter pick out her own Christmas tree ornaments so the pair can decorate together. She said it is interesting to see the colors and styles her toddler gravitates toward, like bold patterns and all shades of pink.\n    \n\n            “I truly think that as kids get older, they do start having their own preferences, and I think it’s super important to include them in that process,” Powell said. “As a mom, I found it is possible to stay true to my own style, while still embracing the colorful chaos that kids bring.”",

        "content": "New York\nCNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            The early morning killing of a top health insurance executive in midtown Manhattan Wednesday has unleashed a flurry of rage and frustration from social media users over denials of their medical claims, a public display of Americans’ pent-up anger at the nation’s complex health insurance industry.\n    \n\n            In one stark example, a Facebook post by UnitedHealth Group expressing sadness about UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson’s death received 62,000 reactions – 57,000 of them laughing emojis. UnitedHealth Group is the parent company of UnitedHealthcare, the division that Thompson ran.\n    \n\n            New York police have yet to determine the shooter’s identity and motive, but in an interview with NBC, Thompson’s widow, Paulette, told the network that “there had been some threats” against her husband, potentially related to “a lack of coverage… I don’t know the details.”\n    \n\n            A source told CNN that there were concerning threats against UnitedHealth Group, although Thompson’s name was not mentioned.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Shimon Prokupecz explains how the deadly attack on UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson unfolded in the heart of New York City.\n\nClipped From Video\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nUnitedHealthcare CEO’s killing shows why companies spend millions to protect their top executives\n\n\n\n\n            A shell casing recovered from two of the bullets at the scene of the shooting had the words “depose” and “delay” written on them, according to law enforcement sources. Police are exploring whether the words indicate a motive since they are similar to the title of a book that’s critical of the broader insurance industry – “Delay Deny Defend.”\n    \n\n            The majority of insured US adults had at least one issue, including denial of claims, with their health insurance in the span of a year, according to a survey released in June 2023 by KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group.\n    \n\n            “Limitations on access to care due to claims denials have absolutely been a source of frustration for a long time,” said Kaye Pestaina, KFF’s director of Program on Patient and Consumer Protections.\n    \n\n            A major industry group for health insurers criticized some of the social media reactions.\n    \n\n            “The people in our industry are mission-driven professionals working to make coverage and care as affordable as possible and to help people navigate the complex medical system,” Mike Tuffin, CEO of the trade association, AHIP, said in a statement. “We condemn any suggestion that threats against our colleagues – or anyone else in our country – are ever acceptable.”\n    \n\n            UnitedHealthcare said in a statement to CNN that its main priorities are to support Thompson’s family, ensure the safety of its employees and work with law enforcement to bring the gunman to justice.\n    \n\n            “We, at UnitedHealth Group, will continue to be there for those who depend upon us for their health care,” the statement said. Other insurers did not return requests for comment.\n    \n\n        Social media backlash\n\n\n            Almost immediately after news broke that Thompson had been killed, social media users began posting about their frustrations with UnitedHealthcare and other insurance companies.\n    \n\n            UnitedHealthcare “denied my surgery two days before it was scheduled. I was in the hospital finance office in tears (when I was supposed to be at the hospital doing pre-op stuff),” one user wrote in an X post that received more than 70,000 likes. “My mother was flying out to see me. My surgeon spent a day and a half pleading my case to United when she probably should have been taking care of her other patients,” she added, before saying the surgery ended up going ahead but calling the process “torture.”\n    \n\n            “My breast cancer surgery was denied” by a different insurance company, another X user posted. “Breast cancer. She asked me ‘well, is it an emergency?’ I don’t know- it’s (f***ing) cancer. What do you think? I had to appeal and luckily it went through. Evil to do that to people,” she said.\n    \n\n            Their stories could not be independently verified by CNN.\n    \n\n            TikTokker and anesthesiologist Brian Schmutzler said in a video that the shooting was “obviously tragic for him, tragic for his family, but this brought up some bigger issues.”\n    \n\n            “From my perspective, we have a bigger issue with the insurance companies in general, who, essentially, it’s their job to make money, not to actually pay for health care,” he said.\n    \n\n            In a blog post Thursday entitled “Why ‘we’ want insurance executives dead,” journalist Taylor Lorenz, who covers social media, analyzed the online responses: “No, that does not mean people should murder them. But if you’ve watched a loved one suffer and die from insurance denial, it’s normal to wish the people responsible would suffer the same fate.”\n    \n\n            Lorenz’s post sparked a wave of backlash online.\n    \n\n        Frightening denials\n\n\n            It’s not uncommon for Americans and their doctors to go through multiple hoops to get approval for the care doctors say their patients need, or to combat denials from carriers.\n    \n\n            “This is care that people’s doctors recommend for them, and some of this care can be frightening,” Sara Collins, senior scholar at The Commonwealth Fund, a health policy foundation, told CNN, giving a cancer diagnosis as an example. “To get any kind of denial or delay while your insurer figures out whether or not they’re going to cover it is frightening for people. To have a decision all of a sudden be being made on the basis of financing is terribly upsetting for families.”\n    \n\n            Nearly one in five insured adults experienced claim denials during a 12-month period, according to KFF’s 2023 survey. Those with job-based insurance or Affordable Care Act policies ran into this problem about twice as often as those covered by Medicare or Medicaid, whose denial rates were around one in 10.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n\n\n\nvideo\n          \n\n\nRelated video\nSecurity expert on connection between shell casing discovery and health care industry\n\n\n\n\n            Restricting access to health care through tools like claim denials and prior authorization, which requires that insurers approve the care in advance, are among the ways that health insurers try to weed out care that’s not medically necessary or not backed by scientific evidence – but it can also increase their profit margins. The practices, which increasingly rely on technology, including artificial intelligence, can infuriate patients and providers alike.\n    \n\n            A class action lawsuit filed last year in US District Court in Minnesota argued that UnitedHealthcare uses AI “in place of real medical professionals to wrongfully deny elderly patients care,” according to the complaint. More than 90% of the denials are reversed through an internal appeal or proceedings before federal administrative law judges, the suit alleges.\n    \n\n            UnitedHealthcare asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit, claiming the plaintiffs must first exhaust the administrative appeal process set by the Medicare Act, among other reasons.\n    \n\n            The denial of claims can lead to major problems for patients, both in terms of care and their finances.\n    \n\n            Last year, UnitedHealthcare settled a case brought by a severely ill college student in Pennsylvania who claimed the company denied coverage for drugs determined necessary by his doctors, leaving him with a medical bill of more than $800,000. The lawsuit, which was chronicled by ProPublica, uncovered the lengths to which the insurer goes to reject claims, including burying medical reports and relying on rubberstamped recommendations from doctors paid by the company.\n    \n\n            Roughly a quarter of consumers whose claims insurance companies denied experienced significant delays in getting medical care or treatment, and about the same share were unable to receive care, the KFF survey found. About a quarter of those said their health declined.\n    \n\n            Having to postpone care because of coverage denials can also affect patients’ mental health. Some 80% of adults said they or a family member were worried or anxious about delays in care, according to a 2023 Commonwealth Fund survey of adults ages 19 to 64.\n    \n\n            Relatively few people try to fight when their insurer turns down their claim. Only 43% of adults in the Commonwealth Fund survey said they or their doctor challenged an insurer’s denial of claim. Some 45% of respondents said they weren’t sure they had the right to appeal the denial, while 40% said they weren’t sure whom to contact. Nearly a quarter said they didn’t have the time.\n    \n\n            But challenging the denial can produce results. Half of those who appealed ultimately had their care approved, the Commonwealth Fund survey found.\n    \n\n        Inappropriate denials in Medicare Advantage\n\n\nInappropriate denials of services and payments by Medicare Advantage insurers – including UnitedHealthcare, the largest player in the swiftly growing market – have come under fire in recent years, particularly from the Department of Health and Human Services, which regulates the program, and from some lawmakers.\n    \n\n            The insurers, which are paid by the federal government to provide Medicare services to enrollees, have at times delayed or denied beneficiaries’ access to medical care – even though the requests met Medicare coverage rules, according to a 2022 report from HHS’ inspector general’s office. Annual federal audits have highlighted “widespread and persistent problems related to inappropriate denials of services and payment,” the office said.\n    \n\n            A central concern is the potential incentive Medicare Advantage plans have to deny access to services and payments to providers in an attempt to increase profits, the office said. Insurers are given a set amount of money per patient regardless of the amount of care received.\n    \n\n            UnitedHealthcare, in particular, has come under public scrutiny as it dramatically increased care denials for its Medicare Advantage enrollees.\n    \n\n            The insurer more than doubled the rate of denials for care following hospital stays between 2020 and 2022 as it implemented machine-assisted technology to automate the process, according to a Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation’s report released in October. That far surpassed its competitors, including Humana, whose care denials grew 54% during the same time period.\n    \n\n            “Despite alarm and criticism in recent years about abuses and excesses, insurers have continued to deny care to vulnerable seniors—simply to make more money,” Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who chairs the subcommittee, said in a statement in October.\n    \n\nCNN’s Jamie Gumbrecht, Majlie de Puy Kamp and Daniel Medina contributed to this report.",

        "content": "A week after taking over the nation’s largest police department, Jessica Tisch found herself on Wednesday reassuring New Yorkers that investigators would “not rest until we identify and apprehend the shooter” who brazenly gunned down the chief executive of UnitedHealthcare outside a Manhattan hotel.\n    \n\n            The high-profile, high-tech manhunt for the masked shooter who killed the head of one of the country’s largest health insurers is the first major hurdle for a new NYPD commissioner long familiar with department culture and a strong proponent of surveillance technology in crime fighting.\n    \n\n            “I want the department to go to the next level – more than just catching bad guys – but how do we use the technology,” Mayor Eric Adams said during a CNN appearance with Tisch the week before she was sworn in on November 25. “She’s planted the seed for some of the technology we’re looking at now.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice place bullet casing markers outside of a Hilton Hotel in Midtown Manhattan in New York, where United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson was fatally shot on December 4, 2024. Brian Thompson was shot and killed just before he was set to attend the company's annual investors' meeting.\n\nSpencer Platt/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nSmudged fingerprint is latest clue in hunt for gunman who killed UnitedHealthcare CEO\n\n\n\n\n            Among the first clues in the frantic hunt for the assailant who killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson were numerous videos and images – from city streets and from a Starbucks store.\n    \n\n            The masked shooter was “lying in wait” for Thompson outside the New York Hilton Midtown Wednesday morning, according to Tisch.\n    \n\n            When Thompson approached the building, a dark-hooded figure with a gray backpack appeared and shot him in the back, surveillance video shows.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrian Thompson\n\nUnitedHealth Group\n\n\n\n            Thompson stumbled forward before turning to face the assailant and falling. The gunman calmly walked toward the CEO and continued to shoot, video shows.\n    \n\n            Thompson was pronounced dead less than half an hour after the incident.\n    \n\n            “It’s never the kind of attention that you want on New York City,” Kenneth Corey, a former NYPD chief of department who worked with Tisch in the intelligence bureau, told CNN of her handling of the CEO shooting investigation so early in her tenure as the department’s 48th commissioner. “So her challenge is really managing that.”\n    \n\n        ‘Case is going to get made on technology’\n\n\n            Investigators told CNN the assailant crossed the street from the hotel, fled through an alleyway, and got on an electric bike before heading north toward Central Park, where he was last seen on video at 6:48 a.m.\n    \n\n            Video from a Starbucks near the hotel showed the assailant buying a bottle of water and two energy bars roughly 30 minutes before the shooting, a senior police official said.\n    \n\n            Tisch, a 12-year NYPD veteran, led the development and implementation of the Domain Awareness System, which the city described in announcing her appointment as “the heart of the NYPD’s crime fighting and counterterrorism operations.”\n    \n\n            The system, which brings together information from license plate readers, tens of thousands of closed-circuit television cameras, facial recognition tools and phone call locations to identify people, has been criticized by civil liberties groups.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImages of the suspect were taken at an establishment near the shooting location, before the shooting occurred, according to law enforcement sources. Police would not confirm the location but the images match with a nearby Starbucks.\n\nNYPD\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nA visual timeline of the UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting\n\n\n\n\n            “This case is going to get made on technology, as so many are today, and she knows probably better than anybody what technology the NYPD has available to it because she brought most of it into the department in the first place,” Corey said.\n    \n\n            “And remember that not all of that technology belongs to the NYPD or belongs to government,” Corey added. “It’s really being able to leverage that technology and to piece it all together.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClipped From Video\n\n\n\nvideo\n          \n\n\nRelated video\nNew York City councilman on new leads in manhunt\n\n\n\n\n            Indeed, investigators tasked with tracing the assailant’s steps have been combing through a mountain of surveillance video, and examining evidence he may have left behind throughout the city and at the scene of the shooting. The search includes thousands of police-monitored and private surveillance cameras. \n\n\n            Police are also developing clues from a burner phone believed to have been dropped by the suspect when he fled the shooting scene. The phone could yield fingerprints, DNA and –– if technicians can unlock it –– other clues to the suspect’s identity, investigators said.\n    \n\n            As of Thursday, police were still trying to access the phone, a law enforcement official said.\n    \n\n            “So you’re going to stitch together, for starters, a video timeline that starts with the shooting and shows this person fleeing,” Corey said. “But they’re also going to rewind that and track him.”\n    \n\n        ‘We have revolutionized law enforcement technology’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice place bullet casing markers outside of a hotel in Midtown Manhattan after United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson was fatally shot.\n\nSpencer Platt/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            During her 12 years at the NYPD, including a stint as deputy commissioner of information and technology – and 17 years overall in city government – Tisch has embraced a high-tech approach to law enforcement. She also oversaw NYPD 911 operations.\n    \n\n            “She spearheaded efforts to use technology to transform the NYPD’s fundamental business processes, including how officers are dispatched and respond to 911 calls, take crime reports, investigate, and search for wanted or missing persons,” the city said in announcing her appointment.\n    \n\n            The mayor’s office credited Tisch with providing every member of the force with a smartphone for access to real-time information in the field. She joined the NYPD – as a civilian – as a counterterrorism analyst in 2008 and headed the implementation of the NYPD’s body-worn camera program, according to the city. She graduated from Harvard College, Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School.\n    \n\n            “I think we have revolutionized law-enforcement technology. We have given officers access to data where and when they need it: in the field and in real time,” Tisch told the Harvard Law Bulletin in 2019. \n\n\n            That high-tech sleuthing has come into play this week as detectives use video and other investigative tools to piece together a timeline of the shooter’s movements.\n    \n\n            Surveillance video appears to show the suspect leaving the subway at 57th Street before the shooting. A massive search of Central Park occurred after detectives reviewed video of the man believed to be the suspect leaving the park on West 77th Street and no longer wearing a backpack.\n    \n\n            And an extensive video canvass led police to a hostel on the Upper West Side, a police official told CNN. The NYPD released photos of a smiling man standing at the front desk of the hostel. Police said he is “wanted for questioning.” It’s unclear when the photos were taken.\n    \n\n            Investigators also have video of the suspect on the Upper West Side carrying what appears to be an electric bicycle battery, the sources said.\n    \n\n        ‘Impressive and unconventional resume’\n\n\n            Former NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton – who coauthored an article this week in City Journal, a publication of the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank – praised Tisch’s “impressive and unconventional resume” as well as her “legal savvy and business acumen.”\n    \n\n            “One question she seems especially well-suited to answer is how the NYPD can leverage new force-multiplier technologies—including AI, facial recognition, drones, and risk-assessment tools—to do more with less, given the recent struggles with recruitment and retention,” the City Journal article said.\n    \n\n            Tisch also served as commissioner of the city’s Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications and, most recently, as head of the Sanitation Department. Tisch’s father, James Tisch, is CEO of the Loews Corp.\n    \n\n            Tisch told the Harvard Business Review that she “very randomly” decided to join the NYPD in 2008 after graduating from law school. She thought it would be difficult finding a job during the financial crisis.\n    \n\n            “I can’t even imagine what someone like me would do at the Police Department,” she recalled saying when a friend suggested she work for the NYPD.\n    \n\n            She is the second female commissioner at the nation’s oldest police department. On CNN last month, Tisch described herself as “a person who takes challenges head-on.”\n    \n\n            “She’s not an outsider and I think that’s important,” Corey said. “And, you know, the old adage is, the only thing that cops hate more than change is the way things are right now. When she sees where change needs to be made, where efficiencies can be gained, she’s not going to be deterred.”\n    \n\nCNN’s Karina Tsui, John Miller, Brynn Gingras, Mark Morales, Amanda Musa, Lauren Mascarenhas, Annette Choi and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.",

Everybody’s ready to go to heaven, but nobody’s willing to take the trip,” Kennedy told CNN’s Lauren Fox.\n    \n\n            While he was referring to the nascent Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a nebulous body Trump plans to set up to gut the Washington bureaucracy and regulations, Kennedy’s comment applies to a broader reality that will weigh on the president-elect when he takes office next year.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRep. Jared Moskowitz (D-FL) speaks during a press conference on December 13, 2023 in Washington, DC.\n\nJemal Countess/Getty Images North/File\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nTrump’s DOGE push finds support from some Democrats on Capitol Hill\n\n\n\n\n            Even the 47th president won’t be able to do everything on his own.\n    \n\n            Trump will be one of the most powerful presidents in modern history, with a monopoly on power in Congress and a sympathetic conservative Supreme Court majority. His dominance of the GOP and power to punish the few remaining party heretics who defy his will suggests he should be able to quickly push through his agenda.\n    \n\n            The president-elect – who leads Vice President Kamala Harris by some 2.4 million votes – swept all seven swing states and became the first Republican in 20 years to win the popular vote while pushing many Democratic districts to the right.\n    \n\n            But lasting policy change cannot be affected without Congress, where the GOP will have an especially narrow margin the House.\n    \n\n        Trump’s congressional conundrum\n\n\n            Trump is expected to push the limits of executive power with a flurry of actions after he’s sworn in on January 20 — so much so that his opponents fear he’ll be a dictator in all but name.\n    \n\n            But the president can’t just decree tax cuts.\n    \n\n            And for all his talk of his historic landslide, Trump’s electoral coattails were minuscule. He delivered the smallest House majority since the Great Depression. And the GOP capture of the Senate can be better explained by the inevitable demise of red-state Democrats in an increasingly polarized nation than some vast MAGA wave. Trump’s 49.9% of the November vote seems an accurate picture of a nation split right down the middle, where the difference of a few points in a handful of states can pick a president and produce massive swings in policy — at least for a term.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump attends a SpaceX launch in Brownsville, Texas, on November 19.\n\nBrandon Bell/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            The idea that congressional Republicans will act as a conscious constraint on Trump is fatuous, given the party’s unwillingness to prevent the president-elect from repeatedly trampling legal and democratic guardrails during his first term, which featured two impeachments but saw Senate Republicans balk at convictions.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStorm clouds pass over the US Capitol in Washington, DC, on January 23, 2023.\n\nJim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nVoters elected the most closely divided House since the Great Depression and WWI\n\n\n\n\n            But Trump may still not have everything his way. The biggest impediment to a successful and sweeping second term may be Republican division and indiscipline and the reticence of some lawmakers to cede all their cherished power to the strongman in the Oval Office.\n    \n\n            To adapt Kennedy’s metaphor, plenty of Republicans want to accompany Trump on a journey to the political paradise of an America made great again. But getting them all to march in that direction, at the same time, is going to prove a huge challenge.\n    \n\n            Trump will need to manage Republican power more effectively in Washington than he did in his first term. His first year in office in 2017 was largely taken up with the chaotic failure to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Trump didn’t sign his signature domestic bill — a massive tax overhaul — until just before Christmas.\n    \n\n            His window for success will be even narrower this time. The 2016 election gave Republicans a House majority of nearly 50 seats. Next year, with several lawmakers likely to leave to serve in the Cabinet, House Speaker Mike Johnson is looking at a possible party breakdown of 217 Republicans and 215 Democrats. Potential Republican replacements after special elections could give him slightly more breathing room, but a few illnesses or untimely deaths in the House could make his majority disappear altogether.\n    \n\n            “Do the math, we have nothing to spare,” Johnson told reporters Wednesday.\n    \n\n        Hegseth’s struggles show Trump may not get everything his way\n\n\n            This perilous situation explains why Trump’s team has been so aggressive in rolling out his Cabinet picks and planning for a fast start in January, amid expectations that if history holds true, the new president’s party could have a tough midterm election in 2026.\n    \n\n            Passing a tax bill is a complex matter at any time — since there are multiple agendas in a governing party and many lawmakers have their favored item on which their vote might depend. Johnson will have to balance the demands of debt hawks, proponents of big defense spending hikes and the needs of more moderate lawmakers from states like New York who will be critical in 2026.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPete Hegseth meets with Sen. Mike Rounds in Washington, DC, on December 5.\n\nBill Clark/CQ Roll Call/AP\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nTrump allies work to save Hegseth in key test of president-elect’s relationship with Senate GOP\n\n\n\n\n            The same is true of historic attempts to trim the size of government by using the congressional power of the purse. Every program that is viewed as superfluous by one lawmaker may be existential to another. A military base, for instance, that officials want to close could be vital to the economy in a swing district.\n    \n\n            In a House majority limited to a handful of seats, every lawmaker becomes a kingmaker.\n    \n\n            Tennessee Rep. Tim Burchett was asked on “CNN This Morning” this week whether he’d stand as a single Republican and hold up business on a point of principle. He told Kasie Hunt: “If it’s morally correct, if it’s something that I really believe in. … If we continue down this path of economic destruction, spending our great grandchildren’s money, yes, I will, and I have.”\n    \n\n            Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the next majority leader, will have slightly more room than Johnson, and budgetary tricks like reconciliation to pass Trump’s priorities with a simple majority in the Senate that could overcome Democratic filibustering.\n    \n\n            But the complications of a relatively narrow Senate majority were also on show all week as Trump’s provocative pick to serve as Defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, tried to convince GOP senators – only three of whom he can afford to lose – to vote for his confirmation next year.\n    \n\n        Musk goes to Washington\n\n\n            On Thursday, Musk stared Washington reality in the face.\n    \n\n            “We need to make sure we’re spending public money well,” Musk said as he swept into a meeting with Thune. But the optics of his visit suggested a rare power imbalance that did not favor the Tesla and SpaceX supremo.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, fourth from left, and Elon Musk, who is carrying his son X Æ A-Xii, arrive for a roundtable meeting to discuss President-elect Donald Trump's planned Department of Government Efficiency, on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, on December 5.\n\nJose Luis Magana/AP\n\n\n\n            DOGE isn’t really a government department and may look more like the quasi-official commissions that have often been used to make recommendations for efficiencies and trimming the federal behemoth. But Trump can’t make cuts on his own — at least constitutionally. Congress still sets spending levels, and the annual White House budget document that is greeted with huge fanfare each year is really not much more than political messaging.\n    \n\n            That means Musk and Ramaswamy will need to get buy in from senior Republicans — like Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who will have immense power as the incoming Senate Appropriations chair next year. There is already speculation that Collins, a relative GOP moderate who faces reelection in 2026, may balk at the size of cuts that Musk is proposing.\n    \n\n            On the campaign trail, for instance, Musk suggested that he could cut $2 trillion out of a federal budget of about $6 trillion. That would mean cuts to programs like Social Security and Medicare.\n    \n\n            Collins said after her meeting with Musk that they had an informal discussion about improving the efficiency and effectiveness of government. “We did not go through any kind of list of cuts or anything like that. We didn’t get into that.”\n    \n\n            If Trump can’t get his planned cuts through Congress, many conservatives want him to use executive powers to simply slice his way through the bureaucracy, like the Schedule F plan that could allow civil servants to be fired like political appointees. The Trump team is considering using “impoundment” — a process in which he would refuse to spend money that Congress appropriates. This might work in the short-term but would potentially poison relationships with congressional Republicans and is certain to trigger legal challenges.\n    \n\n            Then there are the political impediments Trump is yet to consider. Large-scale cuts to government spending would not just potentially hurt thousands of civil servants who could lose their jobs. Those cuts could rebound on the very voters who put Trump into office, many of whom said they wanted relief from the high costs of grocery prices and housing. This raises the question of whether the president-elect, who rarely gets ahead of his base, is really prepared to pay a political price for the kind of cuts Musk and Ramaswamy might propose.\n    \n\n            One House member, for instance, this week suggested that Republicans needed to have the courage to make “hard decisions,” even on Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. “There’s hundreds of billions of dollars to be saved. We just have to have the stomach to take those challenges on,” Georgia Rep. Richard McCormick said on Fox Business.\n    \n\n            But Rep. Stephanie Bice, an Oklahoma Republican, told CNN on Thursday that Social Security cuts should be off the table — in line with Trump’s campaign trail promises — but that there were efficiencies that could be found in government health programs. She added: “I think we can look at inefficiencies from the discretionary side.”\n    \n\n            That sounds a lot like the language many Republicans and Democrats have used through Clinton, Obama and Trump administration government efficiency drives. And it will be familiar to Sen. Kennedy.\n    \n\n            “I hope this time is different. But my experience has been that cutting the budget, cutting waste, everyone knows it’s there, but all of this waste has a constituency,” he told CNN’s Fox.",

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.\n\n\n\nNew York\nCNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            Once upon a time, a brash outsider entered the Oval Office with a promise to “drain the swamp.” He brought in a posse of businesspeople, led by a leading industrialist, to work like “tireless bloodhounds” to root out inefficiencies in Washington’s vast bureaucracy.\n    \n\n            It was 1982, and President Ronald Reagan’s Grace Commission began its quest to get rid of hundreds of billions of dollars in wasteful spending.\n    \n\n            Much like President-elect Donald Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency,” the advisory board led by entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the Grace Commission had no authority to implement changes, only to advise.\n    \n\n            And after a couple of years of work, the Grace Commission’s 150-plus members persuaded Congress to enact exactly zero of its recommendations.\n    \n\n            “You can’t find any evidence that they changed the growth of the government one iota,” Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the center-right think tank the American Action Forum, told CNN. “There are lots of little examples of successes” by the group, he said. “But I think you should ask Elon and Vivek what makes them different than the Grace Commission. How are they different than other things that were unsuccessful?”\n    \n\n            In 2024, as in 1982, there’s a broad consensus that the federal budget is bloated and could benefit from a fresh set of eyes to make the government run more efficiently and save taxpayers’ money. Economists on the left and the right told CNN they’d welcome any good-faith effort to reduce the deficit and tackle government spending. But so far, neither Musk nor Ramaswamy seem to grasp the complexities of the $6.8 trillion US budget.\n    \n\n            “We keep pretending the federal budget is like sitting at the kitchen table, figuring out the family’s finances,” said Holtz-Eakin, a former adviser to John McCain’s 2008 campaign and budget chief under President George W. Bush. “That’s a lie… It’s a fifth of the economy, and it’s very, very difficult to manage and to restructure. And they’re finding that out.”\n    \n\n        The math problem\n\n\n            Musk and Ramaswamy will face an immediate math challenge with finding a way to severely slash spending — especially if they commit to the $2 trillion figure Musk has tossed around.\n    \n\n            Roughly 60% of the federal government’s budget comprises what’s known as mandatory spending — primarily Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. It would be political suicide to dramatically cut funding for those safety-net programs, which is why there is no appetite in Congress to do so. Trump has promised to protect Social Security.\n    \n\n            Another 10% of the budget is spent on paying interest on Uncle Sam’s mountain of debt. That can’t be touched either, at least not without setting off a cataclysmic debt default and market meltdown.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRivian electric vehicles are parked at the Rivian Venice Hub on November 13, in Venice, California.\n\nMario Tama/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nRamaswamy's threat to claw back Rivian loan sparks criticism of Musk’s conflict of interest\n\n\n\n\n            That leaves around 30% of the budget that’s discretionary — but roughly half of that goes to defense spending, another area that would be challenging to dramatically cut.\n    \n\n            “Removing $2T in annual spending will be exceedingly difficult without touching mandatory spending, which would require lawmakers to make the tough choices they have been either unwilling or unable to make,” Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at BTIG, wrote in a recent report to clients.\n    \n\n            Non-defense discretionary spending has already been dialed back, standing at the lowest level in modern history as a percentage of GDP, according to Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi.\n    \n\n            That’s why Zandi said he’s skeptical that focusing on government efficiency could generate even $200 billion a year in annual savings, let alone $2 trillion. (Musk said in October that he could cut at least $2 trillion, but he didn’t specify if he meant annually or over a period of time).\n    \n\n            “I’m all for efforts to improve the efficiency of government,” Zandi said. “But there’s no game-changing 60-yard touchdown pass here. It will be a lot of one- or two-yard runs.”\n    \n\n        A two-pronged approach\n\n\n            In a Wall Street Journal op-ed last month, Musk and Ramaswamy offered a broad sketch of their vision to target “the $500 billion plus in annual federal expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress or being used in ways that Congress never intended.”\n    \n\n            But how, exactly?\n    \n\n            There’s a way, though it’s not always legal, for the president to defy Congress and just refuse to spend money lawmakers have allocated. It’s called impoundment.\n\n\n            “My threat level for DOGE’s recommendations making it through Congress is relatively low,” said Bobby Kogan, the senior director for federal budget policy at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy research group. “My threat level for them doing some things illegally, unilaterally, is incredibly high.”\n    \n\n            Trump has repeatedly said he would challenge the Nixon-era law that curtailed the president’s ability to block funding for projects approved by Congress. The DOGE bros are also on board, writing in their op-ed that they believe the Supreme Court would likely side with Trump.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this March 2019 photo, then-President Donald Trump visits the US Capitol in Washington, DC.\n\nLeah Millis/Reuters\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nWhat is impoundment? How Trump thinks he can control spending without Congress\n\n\n\n\n            A spokesperson for the Trump transition team didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n    \n\n            It’s not clear how an impoundment strategy would play out. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and adviser to Trump, told the Washington Post last month that the administration would likely try a two-pronged strategy: asking Congress to approve drastic spending cuts, while testing the limits of its power to rescind funds unilaterally.\n    \n\n            For example, if the White House wanted to freeze federal funds to schools with vaccine mandates, as the president-elect has suggested, the move would be challenged in court by the school or local government. It would be up to the courts to uphold or overturn that order, potentially holding up vital funds for months or even years.\n    \n\n            “I do think that they’re probably going to lose (some cases) in the courts, but that is a very real path to chaos,” Kogan said.",

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            The last 140 years have been littered with promises by presidents to fix the federal bureaucracy.\n    \n\n            Back in the late 1880s, when unqualified political appointees were wasting taxpayer dollars, there was a move to professionalize government workers in a merit-based bureaucracy. The effort gained momentum after then-President James Garfield was shot and killed by a disaffected former supporter with mental illness who was angry at not getting a job in Garfield’s administration.\n    \n\n        The US has a bureaucracy for a reason\n\n\n            The political “spoils” system, which the bureaucracy replaced, was demonized for its cronyism, inefficiency and graft.\n    \n\n            Now, ironically, President-elect Donald Trump demonizes professional government workers as part of a “deep state,” and his incoming administration wants to uproot and replace them with political appointees more responsive to elected officials.\n    \n\n            History undoing itself.\n    \n\n        Remembering REGO, which came before DOGE\n\n\n            There’s a much more recent and applicable chapter that directly echoes Trump’s appointment of efficiency czars in Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who were on Capitol Hill Thursday to gain support for the nongovernmental advisory effort they’re spinning up and calling the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\n    \n\n            Three decades ago, the new president promising change was Democrat Bill Clinton. His charge to then-Vice President Al Gore was to streamline government through a National Performance Review, or NPR. Supporters referred to it in shorthand as “reinventing government,” or REGO.\n    \n\n        Drain the swamp vs. reinventing government\n\n\n            There are some major differences in the efforts. Trump wants to “drain the swamp” in a punitive way and tells supporters that the government is essentially stealing from them. Clinton, more optimistic, wanted to “reinvent” government to make it work better for Americans.\n    \n\n            Then, as now, the plan was to take a holistic look at government and recommend changes to improve how taxpayer dollars are spent, including by culling the federal workforce, cutting regulations and more.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this September 7, 1993, photo, President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore present a report on increasing government efficiency as part of Clinton's charge of \"reinventing government.\" Surrounding Clinton and Gore are piles of government regulation books outside of the White House.\n\nCynthia Johnson/The Chronicle Collection/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            REGO was not a completely original idea either. Ronald Reagan, for instance, had empaneled the Grace Commission, which sought advice on how to cut waste and government inefficiency from more than 160 corporate executives and issued a 47-volume set of recommendations.\n    \n\n            The difference with REGO, according to Elaine Kamarck, is that Gore’s team was able to follow up on their recommendations and get multiple pieces of legislation passed into law.\n    \n\n            Today, Kamarck is the founding director of the Center for Effective Public Management at the Brookings Institution. But back in 1993, she was running the REGO effort with Gore at the White House.\n    \n\n            “We passed a lot of laws, we cut regulations, and we cut the workforce,” Kamarck told me of the effort, which started as a review process and morphed into a major effort that lasted throughout Clinton’s presidency.\n    \n\n        The insider approach\n\n\n            While Musk and Ramaswamy want to use technology and artificial intelligence to figure out how to shrink the federal workforce, Gore and Kamarck assembled a task force of hundreds of federal workers to spend six months looking across government and issue recommendations by September 1993.\n    \n\n            Even as momentum was building for the “Republican Revolution” in 1994, laws based on REGO’s recommendations were being passed with broad bipartisan support. Buyouts were authorized that helped spur a shrinking of the federal workforce. The Congressional Research Service has a more detailed timeline and assessment of what REGO did and did not do, based on a slew of assessments from what’s now known as the Government Accountability Office.\n    \n\n        ‘The era of big government is over.’ LOL\n\n\n            The REGO effort is what’s behind Clinton’s famous declaration in his 1996 State of the Union address that “the era of big government is over,” when he was in full triangulation mode, appealing to the middle of the country and on the way to a solid reelection.\n    \n\n            With a spiraling national debt and deficit spending in every year since Clinton left office, his claim about the era of big government has not aged well.\n    \n\n            At the same time, by the end of the REGO effort, the federal workforce was reduced by 351,000 positions, federal agencies had been reorganized and reams of red tape had been cut.\n    \n\n            The Congressional Research Service notes that not all of the job cuts could entirely be attributed to REGO, since many of those from the Defense Department had already been underway when Clinton took office. Plus, Republicans won control of Congress for the first time in decades in 1994, and rather than completely fight them, Clinton drafted off their momentum to widen the scope of REGO.\n    \n\n            During the 1996 presidential campaign, Clinton bragged to voters about having the smallest government since John F. Kennedy was president.\n    \n\n            The REGO effort was ultimately rebranded as the National Partnership for Reinventing Government, and it continued throughout the Clinton administration, ceasing operations when he left office. It is also one of the only times in US history when there was a balanced federal budget. A strong economy and reductions in defense spending helped.\n    \n\n        What happened?\n\n\n            I asked Kamarck why, if REGO was a success, federal spending skyrocketed again.\n    \n\n            “Government spending is driven not by the size of the government, but by entitlements,” she argued. “So as the population rises, government spending rises.”\n    \n\n            Plus, the subsequent George W. Bush administration was marked by the 9/11 terror attacks and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which again increased spending.\n    \n\n            Anyone who reads this newsletter with any frequency knows that neither political party is currently talking about reforming either Medicare or Social Security.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElon Musk steps onto stage as Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump addresses a campaign rally from behind bullet resistant glass at the Butler Farm Show fairgrounds on October 05, 2024 in Butler, Pennsylvania. This is the first time that Trump has returned to Butler since he was injured during an attempted assassination on July 13.\n\nAnna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nTrump wants Elon Musk to overhaul the government. Here’s what could be on the chopping block\n\n\n\n\n            Kamarck agrees that it is time to reassess how government functions, and she’s interested to see what Musk and Ramaswamy come up with. She noted that since Election Day, they already appear to be modulating some of their promises. They have not been repeating Musk’s claim he could quickly cut $2 trillion from the federal budget. That “palpably ridiculous” idea would erase most of the money Congress gets to spend each year, she said.\n    \n\n            She worries that Musk and Ramaswamy will present a sledgehammer approach focused entirely on shrinking government rather than improving it.\n    \n\n            Her advice for Ramaswamy and Musk was to look for help inside the government rather than solely from outside. In the REGO effort, civil servants who worked on the project were assigned to review agencies other than their own, she said, which allowed them to apply their federal experience in an objective way.\n    \n\n        Civil servants as allies rather than enemies\n\n\n            That advice was echoed by Peter Morrissey, a senior director at the Volcker Alliance, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for a more experienced and educated public sector workforce.\n    \n\n            He said the size and scale of the federal government and federal spending mean that the focus should not just be on shrinking the number of full-time bureaucrats – which, thanks in part to efforts like REGO, has not grown since the 1960s, even as government spending has skyrocketed. A system where a much larger portion of federal workers change with each administration would be difficult to implement today.\n    \n\n            “The core of senior civil servants who deeply understand how things work, and tend to be very, very high capacity should be thought of as allies in a thoughtful reform effort, not as enemies of reform,” Morrisey said.\n    \n\n            But he agreed there are some correlations between REGO and DOGE.\n    \n\n            “A lot of that 1990s effort was in the early era of digitization and the web, and there was a notion that there could be significant returns to automation in terms of saving costs,” he said. Technological advances would suggest another effort to improve government would be beneficial, something both parties could agree on if they can work on it together.",

        "content": "CNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            It’s been five months since Donald Trump made a surprising promise.\n    \n\n            The candidate known for touting immigration crackdowns told a group of tech investors that he wanted to help foreign students stay in the US.\n    \n\n            “What I want to do, and what I will do, is — you graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,” Trump said during a June interview with “The All-In Podcast.”\n    \n\n            If the president-elect pursues this proposal after he takes office, and if Congress passes the legislation that would be required to enact it, the policy could pave the way for potentially millions of international students to become legal permanent residents.\n    \n\n            But those are big ifs, especially since Trump hasn’t publicly mentioned the proposal since he first floated it, and there are many details we don’t yet know about how his new administration will approach this issue.\n    \n\n            Here’s a look at what Trump has said, how foreign students are feeling about it, how universities are responding, what critics are saying and how likely any of this is to happen.\n    \n\n        Trump suggested a broad policy. Then a campaign spokeswoman described a narrower vision\n\n\n            More than 1.1 million international students were enrolled in US colleges and universities during the 2023-24 academic year, a record high, according to data released last month. Those students generally have nonimmigrant visas that give permission to study in the US, but don’t provide a legal pathway to stay in the country. So the change Trump promised in the podcast interview, if implemented, would be a major policy shift.\n    \n\n\n\n\n            Trump’s comments drew a stark contrast with his previous administration’s policies reducing legal immigration to the US, and with the persistent anti-immigrant sentiment of his presidential campaigns.\n    \n\n            They came in response to a question from venture capitalist Jason Calacanis: “Can you please promise us you will give us more ability to import the best and brightest around the world to America?”\n    \n\n            Trump said he would, then brought up the idea of giving green cards to foreign students graduating from US universities – something the podcast hosts hadn’t mentioned.\n    \n\n            “That includes junior colleges, too,” Trump said. “Anybody graduates from a college — you go in there for two years or four years. If you graduate, or you get a doctorate degree from a college, you should be able to stay in this country.”\n    \n\n            Shortly after the podcast’s release, a campaign spokeswoman offered a narrower vision, stating that graduates would be screened “to exclude all communists, radical Islamists, Hamas supporters, America haters and public charges.”\n    \n\n            “He believes, only after such vetting has taken place, we ought to keep the most skilled graduates who can make significant contributions to America.” spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CNN at the time. “This would only apply to the most thoroughly vetted college graduates who would never undercut American wages or workers.”\n    \n\n        Foreign students say it would change their lives. But they’re skeptical\n\n\n            The green card proposal would dramatically change international students’ lives, according to Metolo Foyet, a 27-year-old geography Ph.D. student from Cameroon at the University of Florida.\n    \n\n            “There are so many things we have to think about. It can be very, very stressful, very quickly,” says Foyet, whose research focus on wildlife conservation. “Having it would erase that pressure. And we can 100% focus on what we need to do and give back to this country who has given so much to us.”\n    \n\n            At first, Dany Rashwan shared that excitement for Trump’s proposal.\n    \n\n            “It could heal a lot of things,” he says.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDany Rashwan, 24, is studying computer engineering at the University of Florida. At a recent career fair, he says he struggled to find companies willing to sponsor international students.\n\nCourtesy Dany Rashwan\n\n\n\n            But the Egyptian computer engineering student at the University of Florida says his excitement didn’t last long. He remembered how stressful his first year in the US was, when new government restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic made foreign students’ lives far more confusing and complicated. It made him realize how precarious international students’ lives in the US can be.\n    \n\n            But Rashwan, who’s 24 and graduating this month, says anything the Trump administration can do to give foreign students more options to remain in the country could make a dramatic difference.\n    \n\n            “Graduating this semester, it was really difficult to find a job,” he says. “I went to the career fair, and out of 200 companies, there were only three that do sponsorship of international students.”\n    \n\n            Haomin Huang, a master’s student in forestry at the University of Georgia, says that given the difficult political environment, he and other international students aren’t holding out hope for Trump’s proposal to become a reality. But many students are frustrated by the uncertainty in the lottery process for applying for work visas post-graduation and would welcome a clearer system, he says.\n    \n\n            “It does not depend on how good you are in your field. It’s just basically based on luck,” he says. “So that’s what we don’t like to see. We would like to see clear paths. ‘You need to do this. You need to take this set of steps. You need to have this, this and this, and you get a job authorization.’”\n    \n\n            The uncertainty makes many foreign students hesitant to stay in the United States, Huang says. Some friends he studied with while getting his undergraduate degree in finance at Auburn University, for example, have already left.\n    \n\n            “Even though some of them got a degree here, they chose to work in Canada or Australia or some country in Europe,” Huang says. “Because of the immigration policy, they chose to leave.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaomin Huang is studying forestry at the University of Georgia after completing his undergraduate degree in finance at Auburn University. He says some of his college friends opted to move to other countries rather than deal with the uncertainties of the US immigration system.\n\nCourtesy Haomin Huang\n\n\n\n        Universities see an opening to find common ground\n\n\n            Raj Echambadi still remembers how stressful it was to wait for his own paperwork to be processed.\n    \n\n            “I have lived that uncertainty,” he says.\n    \n\n            Echambadi came to the United States from India in 1994 as a Ph.D. student in business at the University of Houston.\n    \n\n            Now, 30 years later, he sees the situation from a different vantage point as president of the Illinois Institute of Technology and co-chair of a coalition of university leaders known as the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration.\n    \n\n            “From an institutional point of view, I would hope that this green card promise comes through, because that resolution of uncertainty would mean a lot of good to the institutions,” he says. “But beyond that, I will say, talking as an American, I do personally think … giving a pathway will clearly help us in the global war for talent.”\n    \n\n            A blanket policy providing green cards to all graduates would face an uphill battle for approval, he says. But a narrower approach carving out a pathway for students in particular disciplines, he says, could serve as a helpful pilot program and make a major impact.\n    \n\n            “A graduate degree in let’s say, 13 or 14 disciplines that really matter to the country, to the economic development of the country, to the national security of the country, could be one way to think about it,” he says.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllinois Institute of Technology President Raj Echambadi first came to the US as an international student 30 years ago. He says providing green cards to graduates in certain fields would help the US in the \"global war for talent.\"\n\nCourtesy Illinois Tech\n\n\n\n            It’s not unprecedented for Trump to push for changes to the immigration system aimed at giving the US a competitive edge.\n    \n\n            Trump’s June podcast comments echoed a proposal during the first Trump administration to focus on drawing high-skilled immigrants to the United States, according to Sarah Spreitzer, vice president of government relations for the American Council on Education. That effort, championed by Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, ultimately didn’t go much further than the initial fanfare.\n    \n\n            “Last time, they hadn’t really fleshed out all the details. … It had never really been translated into legislation,” says Spreitzer, whose organization represents more than 1,600 colleges, universities and related associations.\n    \n\n            But hearing Trump mention a similar initiative during the 2024 campaign, Spreitzer says, was encouraging.\n    \n\n            “I think it’s an area that we can collaborate with the administration on,” she says. “I’m hopeful.”\n    \n\n        Critics pushed back quickly. Here’s why they oppose this idea\n\n\n            Trump’s comments drew swift criticism from organizations who normally support the president’s hardline immigration-related proposals. They argued such a policy change would harm Americans’ job prospects and could easily be exploited.\n    \n\n            “It would turn every university (and community college!) into a citizenship-selling machine,” Mark Krikorian wrote in a column for the conservative National Review.\n    \n\n            Krikorian is executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that argues there should be less immigration to the US.\n    \n\n            “There are no numerical limits on the admission of foreign students — who number about 1 million now — and foreign students are already a major profit center for schools large and small,” he wrote. “But if any degree from any school would guarantee a green card (and thus U.S. citizenship, access to welfare, and the ability to bring your relatives), applications would soar at every kind of school, and new schools would pop up like mushrooms.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n            The proposal also drew criticism from a prominent advocate for international students in the US.\n    \n\n            In an opinion piece for Times Higher Education, Institute of International Education CEO Allan Goodman argued many international students want to return home after studying in the US.\n    \n\n            “The dream that encourages them to study abroad is to improve their countries and work in fields where their earnings enable them to live better than if they had stayed in more expensive countries,” Goodman wrote. “However, automatically issuing very tempting green cards, providing a pathway to citizenship, could upset this dynamic and denude students’ native countries of their talents — as well as potentially causing tension in the US about immigration levels.”\n    \n\n        Trump can’t do this alone. Will he push Congress to act?\n\n\n            To call Trump’s podcast comments a policy proposal overstates their significance, Krikorian says.\n    \n\n            “That’s one of those, ‘Don’t take him literally. Take him seriously,’ moments. Because I take him seriously, but I don’t take that literally. ….

        "content": "CNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            It’s been five months since Donald Trump made a surprising promise.\n    \n\n            The candidate known for touting immigration crackdowns told a group of tech investors that he wanted to help foreign students stay in the US.\n    \n\n            “What I want to do, and what I will do, is — you graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,” Trump said during a June interview with “The All-In Podcast.”\n    \n\n            If the president-elect pursues this proposal after he takes office, and if Congress passes the legislation that would be required to enact it, the policy could pave the way for potentially millions of international students to become legal permanent residents.\n    \n\n            But those are big ifs, especially since Trump hasn’t publicly mentioned the proposal since he first floated it, and there are many details we don’t yet know about how his new administration will approach this issue.\n    \n\n            Here’s a look at what Trump has said, how foreign students are feeling about it, how universities are responding, what critics are saying and how likely any of this is to happen.\n    \n\n        Trump suggested a broad policy. Then a campaign spokeswoman described a narrower vision\n\n\n            More than 1.1 million international students were enrolled in US colleges and universities during the 2023-24 academic year, a record high, according to data released last month. Those students generally have nonimmigrant visas that give permission to study in the US, but don’t provide a legal pathway to stay in the country. So the change Trump promised in the podcast interview, if implemented, would be a major policy shift.\n    \n\n\n\n\n            Trump’s comments drew a stark contrast with his previous administration’s policies reducing legal immigration to the US, and with the persistent anti-immigrant sentiment of his presidential campaigns.\n    \n\n            They came in response to a question from venture capitalist Jason Calacanis: “Can you please promise us you will give us more ability to import the best and brightest around the world to America?”\n    \n\n            Trump said he would, then brought up the idea of giving green cards to foreign students graduating from US universities – something the podcast hosts hadn’t mentioned.\n    \n\n            “That includes junior colleges, too,” Trump said. “Anybody graduates from a college — you go in there for two years or four years. If you graduate, or you get a doctorate degree from a college, you should be able to stay in this country.”\n    \n\n            Shortly after the podcast’s release, a campaign spokeswoman offered a narrower vision, stating that graduates would be screened “to exclude all communists, radical Islamists, Hamas supporters, America haters and public charges.”\n    \n\n            “He believes, only after such vetting has taken place, we ought to keep the most skilled graduates who can make significant contributions to America.” spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CNN at the time. “This would only apply to the most thoroughly vetted college graduates who would never undercut American wages or workers.”\n    \n\n        Foreign students say it would change their lives. But they’re skeptical\n\n\n            The green card proposal would dramatically change international students’ lives, according to Metolo Foyet, a 27-year-old geography Ph.D. student from Cameroon at the University of Florida.\n    \n\n            “There are so many things we have to think about. It can be very, very stressful, very quickly,” says Foyet, whose research focus on wildlife conservation. “Having it would erase that pressure. And we can 100% focus on what we need to do and give back to this country who has given so much to us.”\n    \n\n            At first, Dany Rashwan shared that excitement for Trump’s proposal.\n    \n\n            “It could heal a lot of things,” he says.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDany Rashwan, 24, is studying computer engineering at the University of Florida. At a recent career fair, he says he struggled to find companies willing to sponsor international students.\n\nCourtesy Dany Rashwan\n\n\n\n            But the Egyptian computer engineering student at the University of Florida says his excitement didn’t last long. He remembered how stressful his first year in the US was, when new government restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic made foreign students’ lives far more confusing and complicated. It made him realize how precarious international students’ lives in the US can be.\n    \n\n            But Rashwan, who’s 24 and graduating this month, says anything the Trump administration can do to give foreign students more options to remain in the country could make a dramatic difference.\n    \n\n            “Graduating this semester, it was really difficult to find a job,” he says. “I went to the career fair, and out of 200 companies, there were only three that do sponsorship of international students.”\n    \n\n            Haomin Huang, a master’s student in forestry at the University of Georgia, says that given the difficult political environment, he and other international students aren’t holding out hope for Trump’s proposal to become a reality. But many students are frustrated by the uncertainty in the lottery process for applying for work visas post-graduation and would welcome a clearer system, he says.\n    \n\n            “It does not depend on how good you are in your field. It’s just basically based on luck,” he says. “So that’s what we don’t like to see. We would like to see clear paths. ‘You need to do this. You need to take this set of steps. You need to have this, this and this, and you get a job authorization.’”\n    \n\n            The uncertainty makes many foreign students hesitant to stay in the United States, Huang says. Some friends he studied with while getting his undergraduate degree in finance at Auburn University, for example, have already left.\n    \n\n            “Even though some of them got a degree here, they chose to work in Canada or Australia or some country in Europe,” Huang says. “Because of the immigration policy, they chose to leave.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaomin Huang is studying forestry at the University of Georgia after completing his undergraduate degree in finance at Auburn University. He says some of his college friends opted to move to other countries rather than deal with the uncertainties of the US immigration system.\n\nCourtesy Haomin Huang\n\n\n\n        Universities see an opening to find common ground\n\n\n            Raj Echambadi still remembers how stressful it was to wait for his own paperwork to be processed.\n    \n\n            “I have lived that uncertainty,” he says.\n    \n\n            Echambadi came to the United States from India in 1994 as a Ph.D. student in business at the University of Houston.\n    \n\n            Now, 30 years later, he sees the situation from a different vantage point as president of the Illinois Institute of Technology and co-chair of a coalition of university leaders known as the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration.\n    \n\n            “From an institutional point of view, I would hope that this green card promise comes through, because that resolution of uncertainty would mean a lot of good to the institutions,” he says. “But beyond that, I will say, talking as an American, I do personally think … giving a pathway will clearly help us in the global war for talent.”\n    \n\n            A blanket policy providing green cards to all graduates would face an uphill battle for approval, he says. But a narrower approach carving out a pathway for students in particular disciplines, he says, could serve as a helpful pilot program and make a major impact.\n    \n\n            “A graduate degree in let’s say, 13 or 14 disciplines that really matter to the country, to the economic development of the country, to the national security of the country, could be one way to think about it,” he says.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllinois Institute of Technology President Raj Echambadi first came to the US as an international student 30 years ago. He says providing green cards to graduates in certain fields would help the US in the \"global war for talent.\"\n\nCourtesy Illinois Tech\n\n\n\n            It’s not unprecedented for Trump to push for changes to the immigration system aimed at giving the US a competitive edge.\n    \n\n            Trump’s June podcast comments echoed a proposal during the first Trump administration to focus on drawing high-skilled immigrants to the United States, according to Sarah Spreitzer, vice president of government relations for the American Council on Education. That effort, championed by Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, ultimately didn’t go much further than the initial fanfare.\n    \n\n            “Last time, they hadn’t really fleshed out all the details. … It had never really been translated into legislation,” says Spreitzer, whose organization represents more than 1,600 colleges, universities and related associations.\n    \n\n            But hearing Trump mention a similar initiative during the 2024 campaign, Spreitzer says, was encouraging.\n    \n\n            “I think it’s an area that we can collaborate with the administration on,” she says. “I’m hopeful.”\n    \n\n        Critics pushed back quickly. Here’s why they oppose this idea\n\n\n            Trump’s comments drew swift criticism from organizations who normally support the president’s hardline immigration-related proposals. They argued such a policy change would harm Americans’ job prospects and could easily be exploited.\n    \n\n            “It would turn every university (and community college!) into a citizenship-selling machine,” Mark Krikorian wrote in a column for the conservative National Review.\n    \n\n            Krikorian is executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that argues there should be less immigration to the US.\n    \n\n            “There are no numerical limits on the admission of foreign students — who number about 1 million now — and foreign students are already a major profit center for schools large and small,” he wrote. “But if any degree from any school would guarantee a green card (and thus U.S. citizenship, access to welfare, and the ability to bring your relatives), applications would soar at every kind of school, and new schools would pop up like mushrooms.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n            The proposal also drew criticism from a prominent advocate for international students in the US.\n    \n\n            In an opinion piece for Times Higher Education, Institute of International Education CEO Allan Goodman argued many international students want to return home after studying in the US.\n    \n\n            “The dream that encourages them to study abroad is to improve their countries and work in fields where their earnings enable them to live better than if they had stayed in more expensive countries,” Goodman wrote. “However, automatically issuing very tempting green cards, providing a pathway to citizenship, could upset this dynamic and denude students’ native countries of their talents — as well as potentially causing tension in the US about immigration levels.”\n    \n\n        Trump can’t do this alone. Will he push Congress to act?\n\n\n            To call Trump’s podcast comments a policy proposal overstates their significance, Krikorian says.\n    \n\n            “That’s one of those, ‘Don’t take him literally. Take him seriously,’ moments. Because I take him seriously, but I don’t take that literally. …. It’s not something that’s going to happen,” Krikorian says.\n    \n\n            Whether or not Trump means what he said that day in June, he wouldn’t be able to do it alone. Congress would need to pass changes to the Immigration and Nationality Act for such a policy to be put into place.\n    \n\n            “There will be enormous pushback within Congress, even among his own supporters,” Krikorian says.\n    \n\n            And there would be other policy changes that could better achieve Trump’s stated goal of attracting the world’s best and brightest, he says, without any overall immigration increases.\n    \n\n            For example, he says the new Trump administration could consider providing more visas to skilled workers by allocating fewer visas to family members and eliminating the diversity visa lottery, a program that provides up to 50,000 visas per year to people from countries with low levels of immigration to the US.

        "title": "Biden White House considering preemptive pardons for Trump’s perceived enemies",
        "content": "CNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            Senior Biden White House aides, administration officials and prominent defense attorneys in Washington, DC, are discussing potential preemptive pardons or legal aid for people who might be targeted for prosecution by President-elect Donald Trump after he retakes power, multiple sources told CNN.\n    \n\n            Reports of these conversations have captured the attention of Trump’s legal advisers, who, according to a source familiar with their strategy, believe President Joe Biden would be setting a new precedent in terms of the scope of pardons that they could take advantage of, down the line, to help their own allies.\n    \n\n            Biden’s senior aides inside the White House have been deliberating for weeks about the possibility of issuing preemptive pardons, according to the sources familiar with the discussions. The move, which would cover people who haven’t ever been formally accused of any crimes, would be an extraordinary step and shows the grave concerns many Democrats have that Trump will prosecute a range of figures that he considers to be his enemies.\n    \n\n            Trump has publicly called for the jailing of people like Republican former Rep. Liz Cheney, who served as vice chair of the House select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack, as well as special counsel Jack Smith, who brought federal criminal cases against Trump.\n    \n\n            One former senior White House official said aides inside the White House and across various federal agencies are intensely worried about the possibility that the incoming Trump administration will prosecute anyone deemed as having antagonized the president-elect.\n    \n\n            Additionally, several prominent white-collar lawyers across Washington have fielded calls in recent weeks from government officials, including investigators from Smith’s office, who are concerned they could be targeted by the incoming Trump administration.\n    \n\n            Biden and his top aides view Trump’s public threats – particularly against current and former government officials – as unprecedented, and some believe that it would be reckless and irresponsible for Biden to leave office without granting preemptive pardons.\n    \n\n            “You have got (an incoming) president that has basically said he’s going to go after all these people,” a source familiar with the discussions told CNN. “Why not do it?”\n    \n\n            A White House spokesperson declined to comment.\n    \n\n        Possible legal defense funds\n\n\n            According to Politico, which first reported on the internal debate, the discussions are being led by White House counsel Ed Siskel and other senior aides to the president, including chief of staff Jeff Zients.\n    \n\n            The former White House official who spoke to CNN, who is intimately familiar with the workings of the White House counsel’s office, said it would be typical for Siskel and his team to first put together a detailed memo to be presented to Biden.\n    \n\n            In that situation, that memo would include a list of individuals that Biden might consider pardoning preemptively, the context about any prior legal precedent, and a discussion of the wide range of potential ramifications if the president does move forward with these pardons.\n    \n\n            The calls among worried government officials and top white-collar defense lawyers in DC, appear, at this point, to be precautionary. One private attorney told CNN that they’re “feeling out what they should do if something happens” once Trump takes over.\n    \n\n            A spokesman for Smith’s special counsel office declined to comment on whether he would seek a preemptive pardon. CNN previously reported that Smith intends to step down before Trump takes office, instead of being fired, as the president-elect has pledged to do.\n    \n\n            As Democrats brace for the political and legal scrutiny that could come from the new president, his administration, and the GOP-run Congress, one significant concern for many current and former administration officials is the possibility of mounting legal bills.\n    \n\n            Multiple sources said there have been discussions about setting up legal funds to help support those who would not be able to afford thousands of dollars in lawyers’ fees.\n    \n\n            Some of the private practice bar have discussed if influential white-collar practices could work together to help career Justice Department workers – and others who are exiting the federal workforce – to possibly provide them low-cost or pro-bono representation.\n    \n\n            And at least one progressive group is working on assembling resources – such as lawyers, security experts and communications professionals – who could help government officials placed under investigation during the Trump years, some of the people familiar with the discussions said.\n    \n\n        Emboldening Trump?\n\n\n            A source familiar with Trump legal strategy says his team believes Biden’s pardon of his son Hunter has set a new precedent for presidents to issue expansive pardons to their children – and this could be something Trump chooses to do before he leaves office.\n    \n\n            The Hunter Biden pardon was notable for not only forgiving the crimes in his tax and gun indictments, but also for protecting him from being charged with any offense he “may have committed or taken part in” between January 2014 and December 2024.\n    \n\n            There’s also the president’s brother James Biden, who hasn’t faced charges but whose overseas business dealings attracted intense scrutiny from congressional Republicans. Several GOP-run House committees urged the Justice Department to prosecute James Biden in connection with lying to Congress. (He denies all wrongdoing and declined to comment for this story.)\n    \n\n            If Biden goes even further and grants preemptive pardons to an expansive list of individuals, Trump’s team believes that move would also create a new precedent and give Trump political cover to do the same for his allies, according to the source.\n    \n\nCNN reported in 2021 that before Trump left office during his first term, he considered – but did not grant – preemptive pardons for family members, political allies, his personal attorneys, and even for himself, including in the wake of the January 6 insurrection.\n    \n\n            Attorneys across the political spectrum have raised concerns about blanket pardons to protect against future investigations or prosecution.\n    \n\n            “It’s just such a different use of the pardon power,” said Neil Eggleston, former White House counsel to President Barack Obama. “You would create the beginning of a tit for tat where, when any administration is over, you just pardon everybody.”\n    \n\n            Presidential pardons protect against federal Justice Department prosecutions, but do not shield individuals from state-level criminal cases or congressional investigations.\n    \n\n            While Trump has publicly said he wants his Justice Department to go after his perceived adversaries, the system has built-in checks against abuses of power, such as judges that can throw out charges, grand juries that can refuse to indict, juries that can return “not guilty” verdicts, and other safeguards to protect against purely vindictive prosecutions.\n    \n\n            Some prominent former Justice Department officials have said they wouldn’t want a preemptive pardon from Biden, because it might imply they’re conceding there was wrongdoing during their work for the federal government, according to a source familiar with their thinking.\n    \n\n        Trump’s ever-growing enemies list\n\n\n            Trump has a well-documented history of pushing – both publicly and privately – for investigations and prosecutions of his political opponents, almost always based on unproven, baseless and conspiracy-tinged allegations about their supposed activities.\n    \n\n            Many of his recent threats targeted prosecutors who charged him with crimes: Smith, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis.\n    \n\n            He has publicly called for investigations into prominent lawmakers: Cheney and the rest of the January 6 committee members (who he said “should go to jail”), former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (for her supposed “ties to Russia”), Senator-elect Adam Schiff (for his role in the Trump-Ukraine impeachment saga) and a host of other Democratic lawmakers.\n    \n\n            Still, members of Congress have immunity from the Constitution’s “speech or debate clause” that offers such broad protections for their legislative work that even members of the defunct January 6 committee would be unlikely to take seriously any legal threats.\n    \n\n            Trump also has said Vice President Kamala Harris “should be … prosecuted” for letting undocumented immigrants into the country. After the election, Trump called for probes of Iowa pollster Ann Selzer (for “election fraud,” by releasing a poll with Harris ahead), and into stock traders who spread “illegal rumors” about his investment in Truth Social.\n    \n\n            During his first term, some of Trump’s calls for probes were apparently heeded, leading to investigations into 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, former FBI director James Comey, and former FBI deputy director Andy McCabe, now a CNN contributor.\n    \n\n            None of them were ever charged with crimes.\n    \n\n            Some of Trump’s longtime foes who worked on the Russia probe around the 2016 election may not have much legal exposure now because their government service ended so long ago and statutes of limitations may have lapsed.\n    \n\n            There are plenty of other figures that, despite Trump’s calls, weren’t investigated during his first term, but could be scrutinized when he returns to power: former President Barack Obama (for “treason”), former Secretary of State John Kerry (for his contacts with Iran), and even MSNBC host Joe Scarborough (based on a conspiracy theory that he was possibly able to “get away with murder” after one of his interns died in 2001).\n    \n\n            Attorneys who might defend top targets have their own fears, too. Representing Trump administration and political officials had largely gone out of fashion for large DC defense firms in recent years, with few willing to take on clients, especially after January 6.\n    \n\n            The view at Washington’s elite firms – which tend to lean liberal – may be shifting back toward getting involved, but it’s still not clear how much pushback the next Trump presidency may receive from the capital’s powerful law firms, several prominent attorneys told CNN this week.\n    \n\n            “There could well be a fear now by law firm leaders that if we take on those cases, could we ourselves be targeted?”one white-collar lawyer who regularly represents high-profile political figures told CNN on Thursday.\n    \n\n        Focus on political pardons angers activists\n\n\n            Some liberal-leaning and criminal justice reform groups are pushing Biden to focus his final clemency efforts less on family members, political allies or Trump’s potential targets – and instead to help incarcerated Americans whom they believe deserve relief.\n    \n\n            One group, FWD.us, is airing TV ads in the Washington, DC, market, pressing Biden to “give people a second chance,” by granting clemency to Americans with “outdated” prison sentences that they argue would be shorter under today’s laws and policies.\n    \n\n            They’ve pointed to Obama’s record-setting commutations as a model. He reduced the punishments of more than 1,300 convicts, including 500 people serving life sentences.\n    \n\n            “The thousands of people serving disproportionately long and racially disparate sentences in federal prison have been waiting for relief long before the politics of this particular moment,” Zoë Towns, executive director of FWD.us, said in an email. “It is our hope that whatever comes next includes a robust clemency effort focused on them.”\n    \n\n            CNN’s Kayla Tausche and Curt Devine contributed to this report.",

        "title": "As Hegseth’s public profile grew, he faced deepening private turmoil",
        "content": "Minneapolis\nCNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            When President Donald Trump first considered Pete Hegseth for a Cabinet position in 2017 and 2018, he marveled at a soldier who seemed straight out of central casting. The telegenic Fox News host, a decorated combat veteran with a chiseled jaw who spoke forcefully about standing up for his fellow servicemembers, appealed to Trump as he searched for his next secretary of veterans affairs.\n    \n\n            But behind his public facade, Hegseth’s life at the time was in turmoil. He had recently left leadership of a nonprofit advocating for veterans amid allegations that he mismanaged funds and was regularly intoxicated at work events. He was going through an acrimonious divorce with his second wife after having an affair and a child with a Fox News co-worker. And a woman accused him of sexually assaulting her at a Republican conference where he spoke, an allegation he denied and authorities declined to bring charges on.\n    \n\n            Hegseth’s personal troubles barely made the news at the time. Even after Trump went with other candidates for VA secretary, Hegseth stayed close to the president, dining at the White House and discussing military issues with him.\n    \n\n            Since Trump announced Hegseth as a surprise pick for secretary of defense in his second term last month, however, those troubles have broken out into public view. Now, concerns about Hegseth’s treatment of women and use of alcohol are threatening to derail his spot in the Cabinet.\n    \n\n            While Hegseth has attacked the criticism he’s faced as unfounded, Trump is already mulling other candidates to replace him as defense secretary.\n    \n\n            A CNN review of court records, Hegseth’s writings and public statements, and interviews with people close to him show how the tumultuous period of late 2015 through 2017, when Hegseth’s public profile was reaching new heights, set the stage for his struggles over the last few weeks.\n    \n\n            Hegseth’s attorney, Timothy Parlatore, told CNN that the allegations his client has faced about his personal life are “not accurate” and “all fairly ancient history.”\n    \n\n            In comments to reporters Thursday between meetings with the senators who will vote on his confirmation, Hegseth said he was “a different man than I was years ago, and that’s a redemption story that I think a lot of Americans appreciate.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\n\n\nManu Raju asks Hegseth if he would consider dropping out. Hear his response\n                \n\n\n                                02:10\n                            \n - Source:\n                CNN\n\n\n\n\n\n            But several key Republican senators have still declined to endorse Hegseth’s nomination, including Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, a veteran who’s spoken publicly about being a survivor of sexual assault.\n    \n\n            “I think for a number of our senators, they want to make sure that any allegations have been cleared,” Ernst told Fox News on Thursday. “And that’s why we have to have a very thorough vetting.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump defense secretary pick Pete Hegseth on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, on November 21, 2024.\n\nNathan Howard/Reuters/File\n\n\n\n        Shaped by military service\n\n\n            Hegseth grew up in a Minneapolis suburb, where he was a star athlete and high school valedictorian. Growing up in a conservative Christian household, Hegseth wrote in his first book, “I made sure to zealously avoid all forms of sin—especially sex, alcohol, and cursing.”\n    \n\n            But that wouldn’t stick. He went to college at Princeton University and, after working briefly on Wall Street, served in the Minnesota Army National Guard.\n    \n\n            He was deployed to the US detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and then volunteered for a deployment to Baghdad and Samarra, Iraq, where he saw combat while serving as an infantry platoon leader.\n    \n\n            One    of Hegseth’s military superiors in Iraq, who asked not to be named to speak candidly about him, said that “before Pete arrived, we all thought, just what we need, a Princeton smart mouth who’s never served in combat.”\n    \n\n            But Hegseth was impressive, showing strong leadership and staying deliberate even as he faced dozens of memorial services for his fellow troops over the course of a few months. “Pete was quick on his feet, and he always put his soldiers first,” the former colleague said.\n    \n\n            After he returned from his time in Iraq, Hegseth wrote in his 2016 book, he dropped that “pious caricature I had carefully crafted” in his earlier years.\n    \n\n            Now, “I barely trust someone who doesn’t enjoy a few drinks and won’t drop a well-placed F-bomb,” Hegseth wrote. “Not because I think drinking and swearing are good things—but because I think moral lines are better served elsewhere.”\n    \n\n            Those moral lines around drinking – as well as his treatment of women – seemed to trip Hegseth up over the years. His first wife, his high school sweetheart, filed for divorce in 2008, and court records show that a judge wrote he had been unfaithful to her.\n    \n\n            He has also acknowledged that he struggled with the transition from military to civilian life, and that he was drinking heavily in the years after he returned from his deployments.\n    \n\n            “It was a couple weeks between being in combat to sitting in a Manhattan apartment with my cat,” Hegseth said in a 2021 appearance on “The Will Cain Show.” “I’d look around at 10 o’clock and be like, ‘what am I going to do today, how about I drink some beers. How about I go have lunch and have some beers. How about I meet my one or two buddies and have some beers.’ And one beer leads to many.”\n    \n\n            Looking for a renewed sense of purpose, Hegseth joined a nonprofit group, Vets for Freedom, where he has said he got “an absolute baptism in advocacy.”\n    \n\n            During the 2008 election, the group spent millions on ads attacking then-presidential candidate Barack Obama over his policy on the Iraq War. But the campaign fell flat, and the organization ended that year in debt, according to tax records.\n    \n\n            Margaret Hoover, a Republican political consultant and CNN commentator who was an adviser to Vets for Freedom between 2008 and 2010, said Hegseth’s leadership of the small nonprofit makes her doubt his ability to manage the far larger budget and staff of the Pentagon.\n    \n\n            “He mismanaged funds and was not fully transparent about it,” Hoover said.\n    \n\n            Others have defended Hegseth’s role with Vets for Freedom. David Bellavia, co-founder of the nonprofit, called the notion that Hegseth mismanaged funds “absurd” and told CNN the group spent money heavily and strategically to try to sway public thinking.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\n\n\nTapper presses Rick Scott over his support of Hegseth\n                \n\n\n                                04:23\n                            \n - Source:\n                CNN\n\n\n\n\n\n            The organization eventually merged with another group, and Hegseth moved on. He briefly ran for Minnesota’s US Senate seat in 2012, before dropping out after a rival candidate won the Republican Party’s nomination.\n    \n\n            He also volunteered for another deployment to Afghanistan, where he worked to train Afghan security forces. He was awarded a second Bronze Star Medal in 2012, after earning his first for his service in Iraq.\n    \n\n            Hegseth’s experiences serving abroad shaped him more than anything, he said in his Will Cain interview. “Nothing has left a bigger imprint on my heart or on my life or on my perspective of humanity than strapping on boots and walking out the gates with guys you love who you know are just as human as you,” Hegseth said. “It teaches you a lot about yourself.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPete Hegseth speaks to reporters as he leaves the Russell Senate Office Building on November 21, 2024 in Washington, DC.\n\nKevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\n\n\n        A growing public profile\n\n\n            Hegseth’s public profile grew in 2014, when he was hired as a Fox News contributor. He was also leading another nonprofit, Concerned Veterans for America, that advocated for changes to the Department of Veterans Affairs amid criticism over its mismanagement of health care for servicemembers returning from the Middle East.\n    \n\n            Some employees of the group questioned Hegseth’s financial management. Tax records show that while Hegseth oversaw a rise in the nonprofit’s annual revenue from just over $1 million to nearly $16 million, the group spent more than it received in three of the five years in which he served as CEO. In the fiscal year ending September 2016, Hegseth’s last in leadership, the group took in about $437,000 less than it spent and ended up about $37,500 in debt.\n    \n\n            Under Hegseth, CVA also hired his younger brother, Philip, straight out of college, and paid him a total of more than $125,000 between 2014 and 2017, according to tax records. An executive for the organization told American Public Media in 2018 that the younger Hegseth did not report directly to his brother, and that he was “an outstanding employee who made significant contributions” to the group.\n    \n\n            During his leadership, some employees of the group voiced concern about what they described as Hegseth’s excessive drinking and misbehavior as CEO, The New Yorker reported this week. Several employees wrote a memo to another CVA executive laying out multiple examples of Hegseth becoming so intoxicated that he had to be carried away from events and accusing him of overlooking at least one allegation of sexual misconduct by another staff member, according to the magazine. CNN has not reviewed the memo.\n    \n\n            In another letter, the magazine reported, an employee said that Hegseth had drunkenly chanted “Kill all Muslims!” multiple times at an Ohio bar while on a bus tour for the group in 2015.\n    \n\n            Hegseth has denied the allegations, with his lawyer saying they are “outlandish claims” pushed by “a petty and jealous disgruntled former associate of Mr. Hegseth’s.”\n    \n\n            Other coworkers at the group remembered Hegseth as a strong leader. Brandon Davis, who worked as an operations analyst at CVA, said Hegseth was always willing to “go to bat” for his employees and would listen to everyone. Davis said that he hadn’t seen Hegseth drink excessively or act inappropriately toward anyone.\n    \n\n            “He would attend after-parties with us, but he wasn’t out as late as some of us,” Davis told CNN. “He maintained his professionalism.”\n    \n\n            Hegseth left the group in January 2016. The New Yorker reported that he resigned under pressure, although a letter from the group’s trustee said Hegseth voluntarily resigned his position and “provided strong leadership” to the group.\n    \n\n            Hegseth received a $156,000 severance payment between October 2016 and September 2017 and total compensation of more than $172,000 over that period, according to the tax documents, even though he had left the organization months before.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this December 2016 photo, Fox News contributor Pete Hegseth arrives at Trump Tower in New York City as then-President-elect Donald Trump considered him for VA secretary.\n\nSpencer Platt/Getty Images\n\n\n\n        Allegations of alcohol abuse and assault\n\n\n            In December 2016, as Trump prepared to enter the White House, he first considered Hegseth for secretary of veterans affairs. While Hegseth was one of the finalists for the position, some veterans’ groups opposed his candidacy due to his advocacy for allowing vets to seek health care in the private sector, and Trump eventually went with David Shulkin, an under-secretary under Obama.\n    \n\n            But even being considered helped boost Hegseth’s profile. And Trump, an avid Fox News viewer, continued to call Hegseth personally to discuss military issues and goings-on at the network.\n    \n\n            At Fox, Hegseth was receiving more airtime, and was months away from being promoted to co-host of the weekend “Fox & Friends” show. But his behavior was also raising some red flags.\n    \n\n            Hegseth caused a disturbance at Fox’s Christmas party in 2016, which led to a discussion with the network’s human resources department, a person with knowledge of the incident said on condition of anonymity. The disturbance was rooted in the fact that Hegseth, who was married to his second wife, was having an affair with Fox executive producer Jennifer Rauchet, who was also married. The New York Times was first to report on Hegseth’s discussion with HR.\n    \n\n            “We all knew about it, and we all knew we just couldn’t say anything about it,” one of Hegseth’s former fellow Fox hosts told CNN about the affair.\n    \n\n            Parlatore, Hegseth’s attorney, told CNN that an attendee reported Hegseth being “handsy” with Rauchet at the party, and that their interaction was consensual.\n    \n\n            At the time, Fox sources said, Rauchet showed favoritism toward Hegseth, much to the chagrin of other personalities at the network. “She kept putting Pete on TV,” an executive said. After Rauchet got pregnant with Hegseth’s child, the couple disclosed their relationship to Fox management, and Rauchet was moved to a different show. She later left Fox altogether.\n    \n\n            In an interview during Trump’s first term in office, years before Hegseth became Trump’s pick to run the Pentagon, one longtime Fox News producer told CNN that Hegseth also had a drinking habit that was an “open secret” on the set of “Fox & Friends.” The producer said he sometimes noticed beer cans in the trash can inside Hegseth’s office, and once asked his boss, “Does Pete drink before he goes on the air every day?”\n    \n\n            In another interview several years ago, Hegseth’s former fellow host described him as “the life of the party at Fox,” noting that people swarmed around him at company gatherings and female staffers sometimes flirted with him.\n    \n\n            Parlatore denied that Hegseth had any drinking problem at Fox, pointing to public statements from his colleagues supporting him.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPete Hegseth appears on a Fox News broadcast in New York City in February 2019.\n\nRoy Rochlin/Getty Images/File\n\n\n\n            Rauchet gave birth to Hegseth’s baby in August 2017, which appeared to be the last straw for his second wife, Samantha. She filed for divorce a month later.\n    \n\n            Records from the divorce case in Minnesota show the couple accused each other of saying hurtful things to their children about the other parent. A court-appointed parenting consultant chastised Hegseth in one letter for his conduct around his sons, writing that he had shown “hostile and degrading communication” toward Samantha.\n    \n\n            In another filing, Samantha claimed that Hegseth had called her a “f***ing b****” in front of their sons. She said they told her Hegseth had them miss their “first day of online school” for something related to Fox News, which led one of the boys to have an anxiety attack.\n    \n\n            Hegseth stated in a court filing that he thought the court-appointed consultant’s letter was “heavy handed,” though he committed to learning from his mistakes.\n    \n\n            Parlatore said that the proceedings were typical for divorce cases, noting that Hegseth has a great relationship with his kids and adding that “this is why people get divorced – because they fight.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPete Hegseth, host of Fox & Friends, at the National Council of Young Israel Gala in New York, on March 31, 2019.\n\nMichael Brochstein/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nPolice report reveals new details from sexual assault allegation against Trump’s defense secretary nominee\n\n\n\n\n            As the acrimonious divorce proceedings went on, Hegseth traveled to Monterey, California, in October 2017 to speak at the convention of a decades-old Republican women’s group. After his speech, he was seen drinking in a hotel bar with a woman associated with the group.\n    \n\n            That woman later told police that Hegseth sexually assaulted her in his hotel room, recounting that she remembered “saying ‘no’ a lot” and seeing his dog tags “hovering over her face,” according to a police report. She said she had only hazy memories of the alleged attack, and told a hospital nurse that she thought someone might have put something in her drink.\n    \n\n            Hegseth strongly denied assaulting her, saying the encounter was fully consensual. The local district attorney declined to file charges.\n    \n\n            Still, Hegseth later came to a financial settlement with his accuser that included a confidentiality clause, which his lawyer has said was due to fears he would be fired from Fox News amid the #MeToo movement.\n    \n\n            Just two weeks after the alleged assault, Hegseth attended a small private dinner with Trump in the White House’s East Wing along with Rauchet, the mother of his baby, according to a social media photo. It’s unclear whether the president had any idea what was going on in Hegseth’s personal life at the time.\n    \n\n            In March 2018, as Trump planned to remove Shulkin as VA secretary, he again considered Hegseth for the job. He eventually went with Robert Wilkie, a Defense Department official in his administration.\n    \n\n            Around the same time, Hegseth’s mother wrote him an email accusing him of mistreating Samantha and other women, The New York Times reported. She said that she regretted sending the letter, arguing this week that her son is a changed man.\n    \n\n            By 2019, Hegseth appeared to be putting the turmoil in his life behind him: The Monterey case was closed, he had finalized his divorce with Samantha, and he married Rauchet in August 2019 in a ceremony at a Trump golf club in New Jersey.\n    \n\n            Hegseth has described his latest marriage as transformative. He said in an interview with journalist Megyn Kelly this week that he could have previously been characterized as a serial cheater but that he “truly was changed by Jen and my lord and savior Jesus Christ, and I mean that.” He added, “Do I regret those things? Yes. But is it who I am today? No.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPete Hegseth leaves a meeting with U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) at the U.S. Capitol on December 4, 2024 in Washington, DC.\n\nKevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\n\n\n        Cabinet nomination in limbo\n\n\n            While Hegseth had avoided the skeletons in his closet spilling into public view during his first two rounds being considered for Trump’s Cabinet, that didn’t hold true after Trump announced him as his pick for secretary of defense last month.\n    \n\n            Within days, CNN and other news outlets reported on the Monterey sexual assault allegation. Reports from The New Yorker, The New York Times, Vanity Fair and other outlets detailed the claims about his abuse of alcohol, financial mismanagement, and bitter divorces.\n    \n\n            As he’s crisscrossed the Senate over the last two weeks holding meetings with the senators who will decide the fate of his nomination, Hegseth has faced a barrage of questions over the controversies. In recent days, he’s broken his public silence to mount a more forceful defense of his record, telling Kelly that “we’re not backing down one bit.”\n    \n\n            But while Hegseth said Wednesday that Trump had voiced support for him in their conversations, the president-elect has already been considering other candidates to replace Hegseth, potentially including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis or Ernst, the Iowa senator – either of whom would likely have a far easier time in the Senate.\n    \n\n            If Hegseth holds on, he will face a bruising confirmation hearing that could include testimony from women in his past, disapproving colleagues from his nonprofits, or other critics.\n    \n\n            In a gambit to save his nomination, Hegseth has told senators that he would avoid alcohol if he became defense secretary. While he maintained that he had never had a drinking problem, Hegseth said in his interview with Kelly that “this is the biggest deployment of my life, and there won’t be a drop of alcohol on my lips while I’m doing it.”\n    \n\n            That commitment echoed the promise made by John Tower, President George H. W. Bush’s nominee for the job, in 1989, who also faced criticism over his drinking and treatment of women. Tower was rejected by the Senate – a major surprise, considering he himself had served as a senator from Texas for more than two decades.\n    \n\n            James Riddlesperger, a political science professor at Texas Christian University who has written about the Tower nomination, said that Tower’s personal struggles undermined his chances to join the Cabinet even though he had a decadeslong record overseeing military policy. That’s in contrast to Hegseth, someone who has “no experience in the Pentagon, no experience in major-level policy-making for the Defense Department,” he said.\n    \n\n            Hegseth’s nomination, Riddlesperger said, is “only conceivable in a presidency of Donald Trump.”\n    \n\nCNN’s Natasha Bertrand, Andrew Kaczynski, Sara Murray, Jim Sciutto, and Em Steck contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Minneapolis\nCNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            When President Donald Trump first considered Pete Hegseth for a Cabinet position in 2017 and 2018, he marveled at a soldier who seemed straight out of central casting. The telegenic Fox News host, a decorated combat veteran with a chiseled jaw who spoke forcefully about standing up for his fellow servicemembers, appealed to Trump as he searched for his next secretary of veterans affairs.\n    \n\n            But behind his public facade, Hegseth’s life at the time was in turmoil. He had recently left leadership of a nonprofit advocating for veterans amid allegations that he mismanaged funds and was regularly intoxicated at work events. He was going through an acrimonious divorce with his second wife after having an affair and a child with a Fox News co-worker. And a woman accused him of sexually assaulting her at a Republican conference where he spoke, an allegation he denied and authorities declined to bring charges on.\n    \n\n            Hegseth’s personal troubles barely made the news at the time. Even after Trump went with other candidates for VA secretary, Hegseth stayed close to the president, dining at the White House and discussing military issues with him.\n    \n\n            Since Trump announced Hegseth as a surprise pick for secretary of defense in his second term last month, however, those troubles have broken out into public view. Now, concerns about Hegseth’s treatment of women and use of alcohol are threatening to derail his spot in the Cabinet.\n    \n\n            While Hegseth has attacked the criticism he’s faced as unfounded, Trump is already mulling other candidates to replace him as defense secretary.\n    \n\n            A CNN review of court records, Hegseth’s writings and public statements, and interviews with people close to him show how the tumultuous period of late 2015 through 2017, when Hegseth’s public profile was reaching new heights, set the stage for his struggles over the last few weeks.\n    \n\n            Hegseth’s attorney, Timothy Parlatore, told CNN that the allegations his client has faced about his personal life are “not accurate” and “all fairly ancient history.”\n    \n\n            In comments to reporters Thursday between meetings with the senators who will vote on his confirmation, Hegseth said he was “a different man than I was years ago, and that’s a redemption story that I think a lot of Americans appreciate.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\n\n\nManu Raju asks Hegseth if he would consider dropping out.

He was awarded a second Bronze Star Medal in 2012, after earning his first for his service in Iraq.\n    \n\n            Hegseth’s experiences serving abroad shaped him more than anything, he said in his Will Cain interview. “Nothing has left a bigger imprint on my heart or on my life or on my perspective of humanity than strapping on boots and walking out the gates with guys you love who you know are just as human as you,” Hegseth said. “It teaches you a lot about yourself.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPete Hegseth speaks to reporters as he leaves the Russell Senate Office Building on November 21, 2024 in Washington, DC.\n\nKevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\n\n\n        A growing public profile\n\n\n            Hegseth’s public profile grew in 2014, when he was hired as a Fox News contributor. He was also leading another nonprofit, Concerned Veterans for America, that advocated for changes to the Department of Veterans Affairs amid criticism over its mismanagement of health care for servicemembers returning from the Middle East.\n    \n\n            Some employees of the group questioned Hegseth’s financial management. Tax records show that while Hegseth oversaw a rise in the nonprofit’s annual revenue from just over $1 million to nearly $16 million, the group spent more than it received in three of the five years in which he served as CEO. In the fiscal year ending September 2016, Hegseth’s last in leadership, the group took in about $437,000 less than it spent and ended up about $37,500 in debt.\n    \n\n            Under Hegseth, CVA also hired his younger brother, Philip, straight out of college, and paid him a total of more than $125,000 between 2014 and 2017, according to tax records. An executive for the organization told American Public Media in 2018 that the younger Hegseth did not report directly to his brother, and that he was “an outstanding employee who made significant contributions” to the group.\n    \n\n            During his leadership, some employees of the group voiced concern about what they described as Hegseth’s excessive drinking and misbehavior as CEO, The New Yorker reported this week. Several employees wrote a memo to another CVA executive laying out multiple examples of Hegseth becoming so intoxicated that he had to be carried away from events and accusing him of overlooking at least one allegation of sexual misconduct by another staff member, according to the magazine. CNN has not reviewed the memo.\n    \n\n            In another letter, the magazine reported, an employee said that Hegseth had drunkenly chanted “Kill all Muslims!” multiple times at an Ohio bar while on a bus tour for the group in 2015.\n    \n\n            Hegseth has denied the allegations, with his lawyer saying they are “outlandish claims” pushed by “a petty and jealous disgruntled former associate of Mr. Hegseth’s.”\n    \n\n            Other coworkers at the group remembered Hegseth as a strong leader. Brandon Davis, who worked as an operations analyst at CVA, said Hegseth was always willing to “go to bat” for his employees and would listen to everyone. Davis said that he hadn’t seen Hegseth drink excessively or act inappropriately toward anyone.\n    \n\n            “He would attend after-parties with us, but he wasn’t out as late as some of us,” Davis told CNN. “He maintained his professionalism.”\n    \n\n            Hegseth left the group in January 2016. The New Yorker reported that he resigned under pressure, although a letter from the group’s trustee said Hegseth voluntarily resigned his position and “provided strong leadership” to the group.\n    \n\n            Hegseth received a $156,000 severance payment between October 2016 and September 2017 and total compensation of more than $172,000 over that period, according to the tax documents, even though he had left the organization months before.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this December 2016 photo, Fox News contributor Pete Hegseth arrives at Trump Tower in New York City as then-President-elect Donald Trump considered him for VA secretary.\n\nSpencer Platt/Getty Images\n\n\n\n        Allegations of alcohol abuse and assault\n\n\n            In December 2016, as Trump prepared to enter the White House, he first considered Hegseth for secretary of veterans affairs. While Hegseth was one of the finalists for the position, some veterans’ groups opposed his candidacy due to his advocacy for allowing vets to seek health care in the private sector, and Trump eventually went with David Shulkin, an under-secretary under Obama.\n    \n\n            But even being considered helped boost Hegseth’s profile. And Trump, an avid Fox News viewer, continued to call Hegseth personally to discuss military issues and goings-on at the network.\n    \n\n            At Fox, Hegseth was receiving more airtime, and was months away from being promoted to co-host of the weekend “Fox & Friends” show. But his behavior was also raising some red flags.\n    \n\n            Hegseth caused a disturbance at Fox’s Christmas party in 2016, which led to a discussion with the network’s human resources department, a person with knowledge of the incident said on condition of anonymity. The disturbance was rooted in the fact that Hegseth, who was married to his second wife, was having an affair with Fox executive producer Jennifer Rauchet, who was also married. The New York Times was first to report on Hegseth’s discussion with HR.\n    \n\n            “We all knew about it, and we all knew we just couldn’t say anything about it,” one of Hegseth’s former fellow Fox hosts told CNN about the affair.\n    \n\n            Parlatore, Hegseth’s attorney, told CNN that an attendee reported Hegseth being “handsy” with Rauchet at the party, and that their interaction was consensual.\n    \n\n            At the time, Fox sources said, Rauchet showed favoritism toward Hegseth, much to the chagrin of other personalities at the network. “She kept putting Pete on TV,” an executive said. After Rauchet got pregnant with Hegseth’s child, the couple disclosed their relationship to Fox management, and Rauchet was moved to a different show. She later left Fox altogether.\n    \n\n            In an interview during Trump’s first term in office, years before Hegseth became Trump’s pick to run the Pentagon, one longtime Fox News producer told CNN that Hegseth also had a drinking habit that was an “open secret” on the set of “Fox & Friends.” The producer said he sometimes noticed beer cans in the trash can inside Hegseth’s office, and once asked his boss, “Does Pete drink before he goes on the air every day?”\n    \n\n            In another interview several years ago, Hegseth’s former fellow host described him as “the life of the party at Fox,” noting that people swarmed around him at company gatherings and female staffers sometimes flirted with him.\n    \n\n            Parlatore denied that Hegseth had any drinking problem at Fox, pointing to public statements from his colleagues supporting him.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPete Hegseth appears on a Fox News broadcast in New York City in February 2019.\n\nRoy Rochlin/Getty Images/File\n\n\n\n            Rauchet gave birth to Hegseth’s baby in August 2017, which appeared to be the last straw for his second wife, Samantha. She filed for divorce a month later.\n    \n\n            Records from the divorce case in Minnesota show the couple accused each other of saying hurtful things to their children about the other parent. A court-appointed parenting consultant chastised Hegseth in one letter for his conduct around his sons, writing that he had shown “hostile and degrading communication” toward Samantha.\n    \n\n            In another filing, Samantha claimed that Hegseth had called her a “f***ing b****” in front of their sons. She said they told her Hegseth had them miss their “first day of online school” for something related to Fox News, which led one of the boys to have an anxiety attack.\n    \n\n            Hegseth stated in a court filing that he thought the court-appointed consultant’s letter was “heavy handed,” though he committed to learning from his mistakes.\n    \n\n            Parlatore said that the proceedings were typical for divorce cases, noting that Hegseth has a great relationship with his kids and adding that “this is why people get divorced – because they fight.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPete Hegseth, host of Fox & Friends, at the National Council of Young Israel Gala in New York, on March 31, 2019.\n\nMichael Brochstein/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nPolice report reveals new details from sexual assault allegation against Trump’s defense secretary nominee\n\n\n\n\n            As the acrimonious divorce proceedings went on, Hegseth traveled to Monterey, California, in October 2017 to speak at the convention of a decades-old Republican women’s group. After his speech, he was seen drinking in a hotel bar with a woman associated with the group.\n    \n\n            That woman later told police that Hegseth sexually assaulted her in his hotel room, recounting that she remembered “saying ‘no’ a lot” and seeing his dog tags “hovering over her face,” according to a police report. She said she had only hazy memories of the alleged attack, and told a hospital nurse that she thought someone might have put something in her drink.\n    \n\n            Hegseth strongly denied assaulting her, saying the encounter was fully consensual. The local district attorney declined to file charges.\n    \n\n            Still, Hegseth later came to a financial settlement with his accuser that included a confidentiality clause, which his lawyer has said was due to fears he would be fired from Fox News amid the #MeToo movement.\n    \n\n            Just two weeks after the alleged assault, Hegseth attended a small private dinner with Trump in the White House’s East Wing along with Rauchet, the mother of his baby, according to a social media photo. It’s unclear whether the president had any idea what was going on in Hegseth’s personal life at the time.\n    \n\n            In March 2018, as Trump planned to remove Shulkin as VA secretary, he again considered Hegseth for the job. He eventually went with Robert Wilkie, a Defense Department official in his administration.\n    \n\n            Around the same time, Hegseth’s mother wrote him an email accusing him of mistreating Samantha and other women, The New York Times reported. She said that she regretted sending the letter, arguing this week that her son is a changed man.\n    \n\n            By 2019, Hegseth appeared to be putting the turmoil in his life behind him: The Monterey case was closed, he had finalized his divorce with Samantha, and he married Rauchet in August 2019 in a ceremony at a Trump golf club in New Jersey.\n    \n\n            Hegseth has described his latest marriage as transformative. He said in an interview with journalist Megyn Kelly this week that he could have previously been characterized as a serial cheater but that he “truly was changed by Jen and my lord and savior Jesus Christ, and I mean that.” He added, “Do I regret those things? Yes. But is it who I am today? No.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPete Hegseth leaves a meeting with U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) at the U.S. Capitol on December 4, 2024 in Washington, DC.\n\nKevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\n\n\n        Cabinet nomination in limbo\n\n\n            While Hegseth had avoided the skeletons in his closet spilling into public view during his first two rounds being considered for Trump’s Cabinet, that didn’t hold true after Trump announced him as his pick for secretary of defense last month.\n    \n\n            Within days, CNN and other news outlets reported on the Monterey sexual assault allegation. Reports from The New Yorker, The New York Times, Vanity Fair and other outlets detailed the claims about his abuse of alcohol, financial mismanagement, and bitter divorces.\n    \n\n            As he’s crisscrossed the Senate over the last two weeks holding meetings with the senators who will decide the fate of his nomination, Hegseth has faced a barrage of questions over the controversies. In recent days, he’s broken his public silence to mount a more forceful defense of his record, telling Kelly that “we’re not backing down one bit.”\n    \n\n            But while Hegseth said Wednesday that Trump had voiced support for him in their conversations, the president-elect has already been considering other candidates to replace Hegseth, potentially including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis or Ernst, the Iowa senator – either of whom would likely have a far easier time in the Senate.\n    \n\n            If Hegseth holds on, he will face a bruising confirmation hearing that could include testimony from women in his past, disapproving colleagues from his nonprofits, or other critics.\n    \n\n            In a gambit to save his nomination, Hegseth has told senators that he would avoid alcohol if he became defense secretary. While he maintained that he had never had a drinking problem, Hegseth said in his interview with Kelly that “this is the biggest deployment of my life, and there won’t be a drop of alcohol on my lips while I’m doing it.”\n    \n\n            That commitment echoed the promise made by John Tower, President George H. W. Bush’s nominee for the job, in 1989, who also faced criticism over his drinking and treatment of women. Tower was rejected by the Senate – a major surprise, considering he himself had served as a senator from Texas for more than two decades.\n    \n\n            James Riddlesperger, a political science professor at Texas Christian University who has written about the Tower nomination, said that Tower’s personal struggles undermined his chances to join the Cabinet even though he had a decadeslong record overseeing military policy. That’s in contrast to Hegseth, someone who has “no experience in the Pentagon, no experience in major-level policy-making for the Defense Department,” he said.\n    \n\n            Hegseth’s nomination, Riddlesperger said, is “only conceivable in a presidency of Donald Trump.”\n    \n\nCNN’s Natasha Bertrand, Andrew Kaczynski, Sara Murray, Jim Sciutto, and Em Steck contributed to this report.",

        "content": "CNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            Two kindergarten students remain in critical but stable condition after they were wounded in a shooting at a small Christian school north of Sacramento, authorities said on Thursday.\n    \n\n            The boys, 6-year-old Roman Mendez and 5-year-old Elias Wolford, are being treated at a local hospital and have a “very long road ahead of them in terms of recovery,” Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said at a Thursday news conference.\n    \n\n            Mendez sustained two gunshot wounds and Wolford was shot once in the abdomen, the sheriff said. Both boys suffered internal injuries and will undergo “a number of surgeries,” he added.\n    \n\n            The suspect, named by authorities Thursday as 56-year-old Glen Litton, was found dead at the scene from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The FBI is assisting with the investigation.\n    \n\n            The attack at the Feather River Adventist School in Oroville, Northern California, is another example of the scourge of gun violence on American campuses, with at least 78 school shootings recorded so far this year in the United States. Guns are the leading cause of death for children in the US.\n    \n\n            As students huddled in the school gym Wednesday, just feet away from the shooter standing outside, one student said she tried to keep the others calm by sharing words of encouragement.\n    \n\n            “I told the kindergartners to take deep breaths and just think of something happy,” sixth grader Jocelyn Orlando told CNN affiliate KOVR.\n    \n\n            “I told the little graders to close their eyes and cover their ears because he was pacing back and forth from the window.”\n    \n\n            Feather River Adventist School is a private school that serves kindergarten through eighth grade and has an enrollment of about 35 students, according to the sheriff.\n    \n\n            The school is affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, part of the Protestant Christian denomination whose followers believe the Bible is the infallible word of God and in the second coming of Christ. Followers worship on Saturdays and promote a healthy lifestyle.\n    \n\n            In a statement, a communications director with the Northern California Conference of Seventh-day Adventists said they were “deeply saddened” by the incident.\n    \n\n            “Join us as we lift up these children and their families in prayer,” the statement said. “We are grateful for the brave officers of the Butte County Sheriff’s Department who acted quickly to protect our students.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        Suspect released from jail just weeks ago\n\n\n            Authorities were working to determine why the suspect targeted the school and whether he was acting alone, Honea said.\n    \n\n            Initial investigations suggested the shooting appeared to be an isolated incident, he added.\n    \n\n            Litton is described as homeless and a convicted felon, legally prohibiting him from possessing a firearm, Honea said. He spent his time between Sacramento and the Chico area, had a lengthy criminal history and record of mental health issues, according to the sheriff.\n    \n\n            Authorities had received information on Wednesday leading them to believe the suspect had targeted the school because of its affiliation with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Honea said.\n    \n\n            Before the shooting Wednesday, the suspect had attended a meeting with a school administrator, ostensibly to explore the possibility of enrolling a family member, the sheriff said. The meeting was described as “cordial,” he said.\n    \n\n            No concerns were raised at the time and Honea said Thursday the meeting appeared to be a ruse for the suspect to gain access to the campus.\n    \n\n            Litton attended a Seventh-day Adventist School near San Diego when he was a “young man,” and may have had a relative attend the school he targeted many years ago, the sheriff said.\n    \n\n            However, authorities have not determined a “current connection” between Litton and the school in Oroville, he said.\n    \n\n            Investigators were also examining material written by the suspect that appeared to conflate American involvement in conflict in the Middle East with the church, Honea said.\n    \n\n            Litton was first imprisoned in 1991 for theft and subsequently convicted of crimes including theft, fraud and forgery, Honea said.\n    \n\n            The Butte County Sheriff’s Office has not had any contact with Litton since he was booked into the county jail for forgery and fraud charges in 2003, the sheriff said. Most recently, Litton was a suspect in the theft of a U-Haul pickup truck in Chico after he did not return the rental to the company, which reported it stolen to police, Honea said.\n    \n\n            After he was located inside the stolen U-Haul truck, the sheriff said Litton was arrested on November 12 by the South San Francisco Police Department on an outstanding burglary warrant in San Bernardino County and fresh charges of being in possession of a forged license. Litton was then booked into the San Mateo County Jail and transferred to the county jail in San Bernadino.\n    \n\n            The fake license had a photo of Litton along with a fraudulent name that he also used to make appointments to meet with officials at the school he targeted, Honea said.\n    \n\n            On November 21, Litton was released by the court on his own recognizance after he pleaded not guilty. He was then picked up by a family member and taken back to Sacramento, Honea said.\n    \n\n        The shooting\n\n\n            On Wednesday morning, Litton was in the vicinity of a motel in the Chico area, where he had been staying for a few nights at various motels, the sheriff said. He took a bus to Oroville, arriving around 8:30 a.m. and carrying a large duffel bag, he added.\n    \n\n            Under another alias, Litton then called an Uber and was dropped off at the school campus just after noon, Honea said. The Uber driver was identified and interviewed by investigators to determine what the shooter said during the ride, Honea said.\n    \n\n            Litton’s meeting with the school principal centered around “what it would take for him to enroll his grandson in the school,” Honea said. He made up a fake story that his daughter moved to the area and wanted his grandson to attend the school, the sheriff said, as a ruse to set up an appointment to gain access to the campus after the meeting.\n    \n\n            Surveillance footage shows Litton with his hand inside his jacket, near his waistband, where he was concealing his firearm, the sheriff said.\n    \n\n            Children at the school were finishing up their noon break and were heading back to the classroom when Litton pulled out the firearm and initiated the attack, the sheriff said.\n    \n\n            Calls from the Feather River Adventist School about an active shooter were received by authorities just after 1:08 p.m. on Wednesday, Honea said Wednesday.\n    \n\n            Within two minutes, a state highway patrol officer had arrived at the school, where a handgun was found near the body of the suspected shooter, he said.\n    \n\n            Several minutes later, sheriff’s deputies arrived on campus and officers provided first aid to the two wounded students, Honea added.\n    \n\n            Once the scene was secured, the remaining students were taken by bus to a nearby church to be reunited with their parents, the sheriff said.\n    \n\n            Sixth grader Jocelyn’s father expressed his concerns about the shooting and the safety of his children attending a private school saying, “the presumption is that it’s the safest place a parent can send their child.”\n    \n\n            Law enforcement agencies across the state were urged to “be vigilant” and ensure schools associated with the church are safe, Honea added.\n    \n\n            “Whether or not this is a hate crime or whether or not it’s part of some sort of larger scheme at this point, I don’t have enough information to provide an answer to that,” Honea said.\n    \n\n        Family reunification was ‘grief-filled event’\n\n\n            According to recent data, there are about  1.2 million Seventh-day Adventist members in the United States and Canada combined, and nearly 22 million followers worldwide.\n    \n\n            There are more than 7,500 Seventh-day Adventist schools worldwide enrolling more than 1.8 million students.\n    \n\n            The lead pastor of the Oroville Church of Nazarene, Travis Marshall, told CNN the reunification process between children and parents at the church continued through Thursday morning and was “very emotional.”\n    \n\n            “It was a very emotionally charged, traumatic and grief-filled event as parents arrived not knowing exactly the details, not knowing if their child was injured or not,” Marshall said.\n    \n\n            The church received the first call from the sheriff’s office around 1:30 p.m., and 10 church representatives, along with dozens of county sheriffs came to the church to assist with reunification, according to Marshall.\n    \n\n            “A lot of outbursts, praise and tears,” Marshall said. “A lot of hugging going on. Yesterday was one of those events where you get a shared sense of humanity.”\n    \n\n            Food and bottled water were provided to families, and rooms were reserved for counselors and deputies to meet with parents to comfort them as they waited for the children to come by bus, he said.\n    \n\n            “If my child would have been on that bus, it would have been hard for me to wait for their name to be called out,” Marshall said. “One mother simply said, ‘How long? How long?’”\n    \n\n            Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey told the news conference his office was assisting the students and their families.\n    \n\n            “That will be going on now for weeks, obviously months,” Ramsey said. “Not only the children that were previously injured, but those children that saw their classmates gunned down in front of them.”\n    \n\n            California Gov. Gavin Newsom called the shooting “heartbreaking,” in a post on X.\n    \n\n            “Once again, a community is shattered by senseless gun violence. Our hearts are with the children, their families, and everyone impacted by this horrific tragedy. To the survivors of gun violence: You are never alone. California stands with you,” the governor said.\n    \n\n            The co-founder and co-CEO of Sandy Hook Promise, Nicole Hockley, said, “An attack such as this goes against everything we stand for as a nation,” in a statement following the shooting. Hockley’s 6-year-old son Dylan was killed in the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School.\n    \n\n            “In the wake of this shocking and senseless act, our hearts are with these two precious children and their families as they begin a long road ahead dealing with their trauma. We wish them strength and stand with them in solidarity, demanding answers as to why and how this happened,” Hockley said.\n    \n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\n\n  CNN’s Kia Fatahi contributed to this report.\n\n\n  Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the type of school where the shooting happened. It serves kindergarten through eighth grade. Also, the story misattributed a quote about how long students and their families will need assistance. The person who said this was Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey.",

Four representatives of the Ugar Island community, part of the Torres Strait Islands off the northeastern tip of Australia, traveled to Berlin to honor their ancestors and accompany their remains on their journey home.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTe Herekiekie, Te Papa's head of repatriation, and Hinemoana Baker, a writer and musician of Maori heritage, at a  formal handover ceremony in the Linden Museum and Stuttgart Museum \n\nLeif Piechowski/Lichtgut/German Institute/Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nMummified heads of Māori ancestors returned to New Zealand from Germany\n\n\n\n\n            “These ancestral remains were never meant to be here,” said Hermann Parzinger, the head of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, which oversees Berlin’s state museums.\n    \n\n            “They’re here because, during the colonial era and beyond, Europeans presumed to make other peoples and cultures the subject, or more often object, of their research — appropriating artifacts from cultures outside Europe on a scale that is almost unimaginable today and even desecrating the burial places of those communities in the process,” he said.\n    \n\n            Around the turn of the 20th century, he added, Berlin museums set up a network of scientists, travelers, traders and others who sent back cultural items from around the world, and “in racing to compete with the other major European museums, they all too often disregarded the humanity and dignity of the peoples they encountered.”\n    \n\n            The restitution of the remains from Berlin’s Ethnological Museum and the State Museum for Nature and Man in Oldenburg means that 162 sets of ancestral remains have now been returned to Australia from Germany, and about 1,700 from around the world, said Natasha Smith, Australia’s ambassador to Germany. She said the returns are “an extremely high priority” for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and the government.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA person walks through the Margaret Mead Hall of Pacific Peoples in the American Museum of Natural History in New York, Thursday, July 18, 2024.

Tribes are still waiting to get items back\n\n\n\n\n            “It’s sad, but it’s a very joyful moment,” Ugar Island representative Rocky Stephen said at the ceremony honoring the ancestors. “This is a process of healing that’s going to happen when they return back to us.”\n    \n\n            “No matter (if) it was nearly a 40-hour journey to travel here, because it’s been 144 years they have been missed back at their home,” he said.\n    \n\n            Berlin’s museums now aim to do “everything we can to make the repatriation possible” of remains whose countries and communities of origin can be identified and want to bring them home, Parzinger said.\n    \n\n            More broadly, governments and museums in Europe and North America have increasingly sought to resolve ownership disputes over objects looted during colonial times.\n    \n\n            In 2022, for example, Germany and Nigeria signed an agreement paving the way for the return of hundreds of artifacts known as the Benin Bronzes taken from Africa by a British colonial expedition more than 120 years ago.",

        "content": "CNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            The United States is expected to make only minor gains in life expectancy over the next few decades, and this minimal improvement highlights an “alarming trajectory of health challenges” facing the country, researchers say.\n    \n\n            Life expectancy in the US is expected to increase from 78.3 years in 2022 to 80.4 years in 2050, according to forecasting models from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.\n    \n\n            For the analysis, published Thursday in The Lancet, researchers assessed the impacts of hundreds of diseases and other health risks on the US and individual states and compared them to a set of more than 200 other countries.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSA, New York, Manhattan streets. Skyscrapers and crowded streets, cars and busy people walking downtown in a spring sunny day\n\nRawf8/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nUS life expectancy improved in 2022, but child deaths rose, and drug overdoses were deadlier than ever\n\n\n\n\n            They found that the US would lag in life expectancy gains, putting the country behind most other high-income nations and some middle-income nations; In terms of overall life expectancy, the US is expected to fall to 66 out of 204 countries assessed in 2050, down from 49th in 2022.\n    \n\n            Life expectancy among women in the US is predicted to improve less than men’s, shrinking the gap in life expectancy by gender. The US would drop from 51st to 74th in life expectancy for women in 2050 and from 51st to 65th for males, according to the IHME forecasts.\n    \n\n            The slight increase in US life expectancy that’s forecasted for 2050 is driven by a predicted decline in mortality due to a few leading causes of death, including heart disease, stroke and diabetes, according to IHME.\n    \n\n            But addressing a few key risk factors could make even more significant improvements to US life expectancy, the forecasting models suggest. Lower rates of obesity, smoking and drug use disorders could each lead to about a half a year increase in life expectancy by 2050, for example.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW YORK, NY - JANUARY 24: Narcotic consumption material at a safe injection site at OnPoint NYC on Monday, Jan. 24, 2022 in New York, NY.

(Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)\n\nKent Nishimura/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images/File\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nUS overdoses have fallen sharply in recent months, a hopeful shift in trends\n\n\n\n\n            “In spite of modest increases in life expectancy overall, our models forecast health improvements slowing down due to rising rates of obesity, which is a serious risk factor to many chronic diseases and forecasted to leap to levels never before seen,” Christopher Murray, director of IHME and co-senior author of the new research, said in a news release. “The rise in obesity and overweight rates in the U.S., with IHME forecasting over 260 million people affected by 2050, signals a public health crisis of unimaginable scale.”\n    \n\n            GLP-1 medications are booming in popularity in the US with promising outcomes, but the future of uptake remains uncertain and IHME did not include a scenario that included these treatments as a factor.\n    \n\n            Recent data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also suggest that drug overdose deaths have started to decline after reaching record levels, but IHME notes that the levels of drug overdose remain high and will likely increase over the next few decades. IHME estimates that the rate of age-standardized mortality due to drug use disorders in the US will be the highest in the world, and more than twice as high as in Canada at second highest.\n    \n\n\n    Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter\n  \n\nSign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Friday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\n\n            “The stark contrast that’s forecasted in the next 30 years comes after a concerted effort by federal, state, and local government agencies and health systems launched after the opioid crisis was declared a public health emergency in 2017. The opioid epidemic is far from over, and greater effectiveness and continued expansion of programs to prevent and treat drug use are still needed,” Ali Mokdad, IHME professor and lead author of the report, said in the news release.\n    \n\n            Overall, if the US eliminated risk in three key areas – environment, behavioral and metabolic risks, and childhood nutrition and vaccination – there would be about 550,000 fewer deaths in 2050 alone – bringing life expectancy up by nearly four years, in line with current projections for Canada, according to the IHME forecasts.\n    \n\n            “The rapid decline of the U.S. in global rankings from 2022 to 2050 rings the alarm for immediate action. The U.S. must change course and find new and better health strategies and policies that slow down the decline in future health outcomes,” Dr. Stein Emil Vollset, co-senior author and affiliate professor with IHME, said in the news release.",

        "title": "Syrian rebel leader says goal is to ‘overthrow’ Assad regime",
        "content": "Syria\nCNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            The goal of Syria’s rebel coalition, as it wrests another major city from government control this week, is ultimately to overthrow authoritarian President Bashar al-Assad, according to Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, the militant leader of the main group driving the country’s armed opposition.\n    \n\n            In an exclusive interview with CNN, Jolani left no doubt that the ambitions of Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS) – a group that was formed out of a former al Qaeda affiliate – are nothing less than bringing an end to the Assad regime. In his first sit-down media interview in years, at an undisclosed location in Syria, he spoke about plans to create a government based on institutions and a “council chosen by the people.”\n    \n\n            “When we talk about objectives, the goal of the revolution remains the overthrow of this regime. It is our right to use all available means to achieve that goal,” said Jolani.\n    \n\n            “The seeds of the regime’s defeat have always been within it… the Iranians attempted to revive the regime, buying it time, and later the Russians also tried to prop it up. But the truth remains: this regime is dead.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSyrian anti-government fighters cheer as they ride a military vehicle through the streets of Hama on December 5, 2024.\n\nAbdulaziz Ketaz/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            Since bursting out of their pocket of territory in the northwest of the country more than a week ago, the rebels’ progress has been stunningly swift, taking control of the country’s second-largest city Aleppo before capturing the strategic city of Hama. The shock offensive delivered a huge blow to Assad and his backers in Iran and Russia, while reigniting a civil war that had been largely dormant for years.\n    \n\n            Syria’s opposition forces are decentralized and made up of different ideologies, albeit united by a common goal of upending the Assad regime. But HTS and Jolani’s roots in extremist Islamist movements cast a shadow over his ambitions.\n    \n\n            Despite Jolani’s effort to distance his new group from al Qaeda, the United States designated HTS a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 2018 and placed a $10 million bounty on him.\n    \n\n        Emerging from the shadows\n\n\n            For someone who once operated in the shadows, Jolani exuded confidence and tried to project modernity in his meeting with CNN, which took place in broad daylight and with little security. As CNN sat down to interview Jolani, news broke that forces under his command had captured the city of Hama.\n    \n\n            Inside rebel-controlled territory in Syria, it’s clear he operates less like a wanted man and more like a politician. After forces loyal to him took control of Aleppo, he made a public appearance in the city’s historic citadel.\n    \n\n            Jolani says he has gone through episodes of transformation through the years. “A person in their twenties will have a different personality than someone in their thirties or forties, and certainly someone in their fifties. This is human nature.”\n    \n\n            Jolani cut his teeth as a young fighter for al Qaeda against the US in Iraq. Returning to his homeland during the Syrian civil war, he led the terror group’s affiliate in Syria when it was under the name Jabhat Al Nusra. He would go on to break ties with al Qaeda and his organization evolved into Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham, also known as the Organization for the Liberation of the Levant, in early 2017.\n    \n\n            The US, Turkey, the United Nations and several other Western nations continue to designate HTS as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, despite the group’s attempts to distance itself from its roots.\n    \n\n            Jolani’s interview with CNN on Thursday was an about-face from the hardline rhetoric that he used during his first-ever televised interview in 2013, when he was interviewed by Al Jazeera with his face in shadow. At the time, his remarks were focused on furthering al Qaeda’s branch in Syria.\n    \n\n            On Thursday, Jolani projected a different vision for the war-torn country. In a sign of his attempted rebranding, he also publicly used his real name for the first time – Ahmed al-Sharaa – instead of the nom de guerre by which he is widely known.\n    \n\n\n\n\n            As the rebel coalition’s military advances expand the territory and population under their control, Jolani insisted that civilians had little to fear in the management of rebel-held areas of Syria. “People who fear Islamic governance either have seen incorrect implementations of it or do not understand it properly,” he claimed.\n    \n\n            If opposition forces succeed in toppling Assad’s regime, it will transition into “a state of governance, institutions and so on,” he envisioned.\n    \n\n            The group said it is working to reassure civilians and groups that suffered persecution at the hands of extremist and jihadist groups in Syria’s decade-long civil war. It also said it has gone out of its way to publicly tell Christians and other religious and ethnic minorities that they will live safely under its rule.\n    \n\n            “There were some violations against them [minorities] by certain individuals during periods of chaos, but we addressed these issues,” Jolani said when asked about concerns for their safety.\n    \n\n            “No one has the right to erase another group. These sects have coexisted in this region for hundreds of years, and no one has the right to eliminate them,” he said.\n    \n\n            Human rights groups and local monitors have nevertheless raised alarm about HTS’ more recent treatment of political dissidents in Idlib, alleging that the group conducted harsh crackdowns on protests and tortured and abused dissidents. Jolani told CNN that incidents of abuse in prisons “were not done under our orders or directions” and HTS had already held those involved accountable.\n    \n\n            Jolani also pushed back against the enduring terror designation of HTS, calling the label “primarily political and, at the same time, inaccurate,” arguing that some extreme Islamist practices had “created a divide” between HTS and jihadist groups. He claimed that he was opposed to some of the more brutal tactics used by other jihadi groups which led to his severing ties with them. He also claimed that he was never personally involved in attacks on civilians.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA view from 66 Air Defense Brigade of the regime's army and its air defense systems and various military ammunition captured by anti-regime armed groups, opposing the Bashar al-Assad regime, as they seize the city center of Hama, Syria on December 5, 2024.\n\nIbrahim Hatib/Anadolu/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            When CNN visited Aleppo earlier in the day, the team found a city that appeared calm despite the sudden takeover by opposition forces just last week. Markets were open, people were walking the streets and life was carrying on, even after bombings by pro-Assad Russian warplanes that have killed scores of people in rebel-held areas.\n    \n\n            Assad’s chokehold on the country has been reinforced by his allies. As anti-government forces grew in the aftermath of the 2011 Arab Spring, Iran’s Revolutionary Guard as well as its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah helped fight the armed rebel groups on the ground. In the skies, the Syrian Air Force was bolstered by Russian warplanes.\n    \n\n            Jolani expressed a desire to see foreign forces leave Syria. There are currently forces from the US, Turkey, Russia and Iran as well as Iranian proxies in the country. “I think that once this regime falls, the issue will be resolved, and there will no longer be a need for any foreign forces to remain in Syria.”\n    \n\n            “Syria deserves a governing system that is institutional, not one where a single ruler makes arbitrary decisions,” he added. The Assad dynasty has been in power for 53 years, since 1971. To maintain its decades-long rule, the regime has killed hundreds of thousands of people, jailed dissidents and brutally displaced millions internally and abroad.\n    \n\n            “We are talking about a larger project – we are talking about building Syria,” Jolani continued. “Hayat Tahrir al-Sham is merely one part of this dialogue, and it may dissolve at any time. It is not an end in itself but a means to perform a task: confronting this regime.”\n    \n\nCNN’s Mostafa Salem and Isil Sariyuce contributed to this report.",

        "content": "CNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            The Village People’s lyricist and lead singer has hit out at the “false assumption” that the band’s biggest hit, “YMCA,” is a “gay anthem.”\n    \n\n            Victor Willis, who headed up the 1970s disco band and wrote the song with producer Jacques Morali, has taken to social media to insist that it was not written with the gay community in mind – and that those who suggest otherwise could soon face legal action.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n\n\n\nvideo\n          \n\n\nRelated video\nTrump dances for 30 minutes at campaign event\n\n\n\n\n            “There’s been a lot of talk, especially of late, that Y.M.C.A. is somehow a gay anthem,” Willis, who wrote the lyrics for the 1978 hit, said on Facebook on Monday. “As I’ve said numerous times in the past, that is a false assumption based on the fact that my writing partner was gay, and some (not all) of Village People were gay, and that the first Village People album was totally about gay life.\n    \n\n            “This assumption is also based on the fact that the YMCA was apparently being used as some sort of gay hangout and since one of the writers was gay and some of the Village People are gay, the song must be a message to gay people. To that I say once again, get your minds out of the gutter. It is not.”\n    \n\n            The song, from the band’s third studio album, “Cruisin,’” has spent years as an informal anthem of the LGBTQ community. But it has also been more recently embraced by Donald Trump, who has been playing it at presidential campaign rallies. A recent video posted online showed the president-elect dancing to the hit with Tesla CEO Elon Musk in Mar-A-Lago over Thanksgiving.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Village People pose for a Casablanca Records publicity shot circa 1978.\n\nMichael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            Like many others in the music industry, including ABBA and the Foo Fighters, Willis initially objected to his song being used by Trump. But in his Facebook post he gave the president-elect his blessing to use the song, which has surged once again in popularity, topping the Billboard chart for digital sales of dance and electronic music this week.\n    \n\n            The YMCA – whose full name is the Young Men’s Christian Association – was originally set up as a non-political Christian movement in London in 1844. Commonly referred to as “the Y,” it has since become a global organization where men are welcome to come and exercise, play sport and seek shelter.\n    \n\n            Willis said that when writing the song he had no idea that the YMCA was “a hang out for gays.”\n    \n\n            He said: “I therefore wrote Y.M.C.A. about the things I knew about the Y in the urban areas of San Francisco such as swimming, basketball, track, and cheap food and cheap rooms. And when I say, ‘hang out with all the boys’ that is simply 1970s black slang for black guys hanging-out together for sports, gambling or whatever. There’s nothing gay about that.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyoncé, Celine Dion and Dave Grohl\n\nGetty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nCan Beyoncé, Celine Dion and Foo Fighters stop Trump from using their music? It’s complicated\n\n\n\n\n            “So, to the extent that Y.M.C.A. is considered a gay anthem based on the fact that gays once used certain YMCA’s for elicit activity, the assumption that the song alludes to that is completely misguided.”\n    \n\n            Willis’ feelings on the matter are so strong that he is now threatening legal action over the issue.\n    \n\n            He continued: “Since I wrote the lyrics and ought to know what the lyrics I wrote is really about, come January 2025, my wife will start suing each and every news organization that falsely refers to Y.M.C.A., either in their headlines or alluded to in the base of the story, that Y.M.C.A. is somehow a gay anthem because such notion is based solely on the song’s lyrics alluding to elicit activity for which it does not. However, I don’t mind that gays think of the song as their anthem.\n    \n\n            “But you’d be hard-pressed to find Y.M.C.A. on the play list at any gay club, parade or other gay activity in a way that would suggest it’s somehow an anthem to the community other than alluding to illicit activity, which is defamatory, and damaging to the song. But it stops in 2025.”",

It really is a traveling family,” F1 chief communications and corporate relations officer Liam Parker told CNN.\n    \n\n            “We’re everywhere, and that’s what makes it special. It really is a global sporting spectacular … It’s not just racing anymore – it’s entertainment, it’s music, it’s celebrity.”\n    \n\n            Even after a decade of reporting on the sport, PA Media’s F1 correspondent Phil Duncan still marvels at how teams cope.\n    \n\n            “We’re talking about as many as 4,000 people (team staff) traveling to all the different races,” Duncan told CNN.\n    \n\n            “How they manage to transport all the people around the world, all the hardware, the cars, the machinery, the parts – it’s quite a remarkable achievement.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt takes a monumental logistical effort to simply get cars on the track.\n\nAndrej Isakovic/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\n        Pressure\n\n\n            So, to take the Qatar Grand Prix as a case study, just how do they do it?\n    \n\n            It’s certainly not by getting plenty of sleep, insists Aston Martin race team coordinator Joe Micklewright, a former sous chef whose myriad responsibilities on race week began the second he arrived – bleary-eyed – in Doha on Monday following a 17-hour flight.\n    \n\n            Lusail International Circuit marked the middle leg of a triple-header – three race weekends in a row – to close out the 2024 season, sandwiched between Las Vegas and the final Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi on December 8.\n    \n\n            After snagging a few hours of sleep, Micklewright awoke Tuesday morning to meet the air freight carrying some 25 tons of essential cargo – including the two cars – that he had arranged to follow him some 8,000 miles from the US.\n    \n\n            And that’s not to mention enough tables, chairs and other pieces of less critical garage equipment to fill five separate shipping containers that arrive via sea freight. Aston Martin alternates six sets of such containers globally in order to reach all 24 races in time, with the Doha shipment already en route to Australia for the 2025 curtain-raiser in March.\n    \n\n            That all adds up to approximately 50 tons of freight transported to every Grand Prix by each team.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMechanics work on Alonso's car ahead of the Qatar Grand Prix.\n\nMahmud Hams/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\n            With such tight deadlines – including a strict curfew that restricts the amount of time staff can work on the cars on a Wednesday and Thursday of a race week (roughly 12 hours each day) – even the most minor of travel complications can be acutely damaging.\n    \n\n            “We do have a lot of pressure,” said Micklewright, adding that a customs delay led to the air freight arriving almost four hours late to Doha.\n    \n\n            “We’ve got to get the right equipment to the right place at the right time and our paperwork has got to be up to scratch. Otherwise, it all just creates delays and that just has a knock-on effect all the time.”\n    \n\n            Assembly of the cars, each comprising some 5,000 components, begins Wednesday as the garage is assembled around it in order to be fully functional by Thursday.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLewis Hamilton of Great Britain and Mercedes looks on in the Paddock after practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Las Vegas at Las Vegas Strip Circuit on November 21, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nChris Graythen/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\n‘We created history together’: Lewis Hamilton on writing one of F1’s greatest chapters with Mercedes\n\n\n\n\n            On Friday, Saturday and Sunday – practice, qualifying and the Grand Prix respectively – Micklewright is part of the crew tasked with looking after driver Fernando Alonso’s tires, even getting involved in pit stops if required.\n    \n\n            This role is simply one more paragraph on his extensive job description, with Micklewright’s other duties including maintenance of the garage, handling any ad hoc team issues with hotels or car hire, and liaising with some of the roughly 800 staff back at team headquarters in Silverstone, England.\n    \n\n            As jet lag compounds the general fatigue of a globetrotting campaign that began in earnest with the unveiling of the 2024 car in February, leaning on the support of the “traveling family” is paramount.\n    \n\n            “It does take a toll on you, especially at the end of the season. You do get quite tired,” Micklewright admitted.\n    \n\n            “When things aren’t going well, you’ve got to stick together, put your arm around each other and make sure you just get through it. You’ve just got to keep going.”\n    \n\n        ‘There’s no better feeling’\n\n\n            It’s a sentiment echoed by Micklewright’s logistical counterpart at rival team Haas, trackside operations manager Neil Hanley.\n    \n\n            With less than 300 total staff spread across England, Italy and the US, Haas are the smallest team on the grid, according to Hanley, who begins drawing up schematics for the garage six weeks before each race.\n    \n\n            Such foreplanning is essential given the comparative lack of personnel, but what Haas – currently seventh in the Constructors’ Championship – lacks in numbers it makes up for in heart and camaraderie, Hanley insists.\n    \n\n            “They are just a great bunch of people,” he told CNN.\n    \n\n            “It starts even from the catering team, our logistics suppliers. Without them, we wouldn’t be where we are. We wouldn’t get those points without the mechanics on the ground … without the engineering departments, without the management and the engineers and the drivers, if we didn’t work as a cohesive team.”\n    \n\n            “Sunday night when that checkered flag goes down, if we’ve got one or two cars in the points – there’s no better feeling,” he added.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaas' Nico Hulkenberg on track during practice ahead of the Qatar Grand Prix at Lusail International Circuit on November 29.\n\nClive Mason/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            That flag drop signals the start of a mad dash to totally disassemble the garage and pack all the equipment onto their respective freights, an operation that extended well into early Monday morning in Doha.\n    \n\n            Past the halfway mark of a “brutal” triple-header, it is only when Hanley boards a plane bound for Abu Dhabi a couple of hours later – blissfully uncontactable – that he can catch his breath.\n    \n\n            That’s until landing, when the circus reopens again.\n    \n\n            “It doesn’t stop,” Hanley said. “We can’t just say its the hours at one race – it’s hundreds, thousands of hours just to get these cars on the ground. Twelve hours a day, seven days a week at one event.\n    \n\n            “Those sat (watching) on the sofas, who haven’t got family members or loved ones within a team, probably wouldn’t see or know the amount of time we spend on the road.”",

You do get quite tired,” Micklewright admitted.\n    \n\n            “When things aren’t going well, you’ve got to stick together, put your arm around each other and make sure you just get through it.

Twelve hours a day, seven days a week at one event.\n    \n\n            “Those sat (watching) on the sofas, who haven’t got family members or loved ones within a team, probably wouldn’t see or know the amount of time we spend on the road.”",

        "content": "CNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            On a cold November morning, Irina Turbina packs bags filled with food, adds two large shower gels, two bulky packs of toilet paper, nail clippers, a novel, and a geography atlas, and sets out on a grueling two-day trip. The bags and books are for her son, 16-year-old Arseny. It might be her last chance to catch a glimpse of him before he is sent to a juvenile correctional colony to serve a five-year sentence.\n    \n\n            Arseny Turbin is recognized by several human rights groups as one of Russia’s youngest political prisoners. He was sentenced in June after being found guilty of terror offenses for allegedly joining the Freedom of Russia Legion, a paramilitary unit of Russian volunteers fighting for Ukraine. He admits he contacted the group but denies he joined, and his mother maintains he is innocent.\n    \n\n            He is among at least 35 minors who have faced politically motivated criminal charges in Russia since 2009, according to the independent monitoring organization OVD-Info. Of those, 23 cases have been initiated since Russia started its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n    \n\n            Turbina, who lives in the small town of Livny in the Oryol region, some 300 miles to the south of Moscow, has made the long journey to a pre-trial detention center on the outskirts of the capital every two weeks, as visits are restricted to twice a month. After hours of waiting, she sees her son through a barred glass partition, speaking only by telephone. Holding hands or touching is strictly prohibited.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nArseny Turbin, 16, was sentenced in June to serve five years in prison for terror offenses. He denies the charges. CNN has blurred the face of the other person pictured to protect her privacy.\n\nIrina Turbina\n\n\n\n            “The last time I hugged him was June 20, the day the verdict was pronounced,” she recounted in a phone interview with CNN. “He hugged me, cried, and then the guards immediately came up and took him away.”\n    \n\n            In August, a year after he was first questioned, Arseny marked his 16th birthday behind bars.\n    \n\n            “Please, I’m asking you to do everything you can to make sure I get released,” Arseny begged his mom in a letter written ahead of an appeal hearing last month and shared with CNN. He had lost 15 kilograms (33 pounds) due to a stress-induced lack of appetite and had been moved to a different cell after episodes of violence from fellow inmates, he said, describing the situation to his mother as “very difficult, critical.”\n    \n\n            When Irina got this letter, she couldn’t hold back her tears. “I cried because I understand that I am already doing the best I can,” she told CNN. “But I know it’s not enough, and that I can’t change the system.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt from a letter written by Arseny Turbin to his mother and shared with CNN.\n\nPhoto Illustration by Leah Abucayan/CNN\n\n\n\n            His appeal to overturn his five-year sentence was denied. The next day, Irina came again for a visit, prepared to demonstrate her strength and resilience to help Arseny cope with the devastating ruling.\n    \n\n            “I said, ‘Arseny, I’m so proud of you,’” she recalled. “‘You are actually stronger than the people who convicted you,’” she told him, “‘because you have the right to express your opinion and position, while these people only do what they have to do.’”\n    \n\n            Her only child faces being moved to a correctional facility for teenagers but for the moment remains in Detention Center No. 5.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideos provided by Irina Turbina show Arseny enjoying moments of everyday life, from swimming to a snowy walk with his mother, before his imprisonment.\nIrina Turbina\n\n\n\n\n        ‘I’m terrified for him’\n\n\n            Turbina still struggles to comprehend how this happened. “He is just a kid, he has been different since early childhood,” she said. She describes Arseny as someone with “a love for books and studying,” who showed an interest in politics as early as 14, liked to “delve into everything,” and was not afraid to speak his mind and tell the wrong from the right at school or online.\n    \n\n            In April 2023, Arseny called a morning live show on TV Rain, an independent network based outside of Russia, to vent about his disappointment in President Vladimir Putin and call out state propaganda at his school. “Human rights are being violated,” he said.\n    \n\n            Then on June 12, Russia Day, Irina says he staged a solo protest in their hometown and printed out leaflets that read “I am against Putin” and “freedom for political prisoners,” among other anti-government slogans. She tried her best to discourage him, fearing what might happen.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\n\n\nArseny Turbin, then 15, stages a solo protest in June last year in his hometown of Livny.\n                \n\n\n                                00:24\n                            \n - Source:\n                CNN\n\n\n\n\n\n            “He said ‘Mom, don’t worry, I’m not violating the law,’” Irina recounted. She told him the authorities would go after them, but he didn’t believe her.\n    \n\n            Early on August 29, 2023, officers from the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) knocked on their door. They searched the apartment and took away personal items including a tablet, a laptop, and cell phones.\n    \n\n            Arseny was placed under house arrest in September with the right to attend school. In the fall of 2023, Russia’s financial monitoring agency designated Turbin as a “terrorist and extremist” on its official list. ﻿Then this summer, on June 20, came the sentencing.\n    \n\n            Turbina is deeply fearful of the toll the penitentiary system may take on her son. “I’m terrified for him,” she confided to CNN. “I’m worried how he will spend these years and whether part of him will break. I want to believe that he will be strong until the end and will pass the test with dignity. But he is still just a child after all, and what if, at some point, some circumstances might break him?”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn excerpt from another letter sent by Arseny Turbin to his mother, and shared with CNN, describes tough conditions in detention.\n\nIllustration by Leah Abucayan/CNN\n\n\n\n            Arseny’s is not an isolated case. Russian law permits the prosecution of children as young as 14 for serious crimes, including terrorism and treason — broad charges increasingly pursued against young people since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, said Sergei Davidis, who heads the Political Prisoners Support Program at Memorial Human Rights Center.\n    \n\n            This reflects a broader escalation in Moscow’s crackdown on dissent, which began before the war but has intensified since February 2022. Since then, at least 20,070 people have been detained for anti-war views, and 9,369 cases of “discrediting the army” have been recorded, relating to actions including social media posts or wearing clothes with Ukrainian flag symbols, said Dmitry Anisimov, spokesperson for OVD-Info.\n    \n\n            Parents and caregivers have also been targeted through harassment, arbitrary arrests, and even threats of losing custody of their children, according to independent monitoring organizations such as OVD-Info and Memorial.\n    \n\n            The Kremlin consistently denies the existence of political prisoners in Russia, claiming all incarcerations are based on legal violations, despite human rights organizations indicating otherwise.\n    \n\n        ‘Not just statistics’\n\n\n            Kevin Lick, a 19-year-old dual Russian-German citizen, knows the price of dissent in modern Russia all too well. Arrested at 17, a year after the war in Ukraine began, he was sentenced to serve four years in a penal colony, becoming the youngest person in modern Russian history ever to be convicted of state treason.\n    \n\n            Prosecutors accused him of photographing military objects with the intent to share them with foreign intelligence – claims Lick denies.\n    \n\n            During his imprisonment, the teenager says he was put in solitary confinement, endured physical abuse and brutal prison conditions. “Looking back, of course, it left scars,” he said, acknowledging his ongoing struggle with PTSD.\n    \n\n            Russian authorities have not publicly addressed the claims, nor has Russia’s Federal Penitentiary Service responded to CNN’s request for comment regarding allegations that teenagers in detention have suffered violence and mistreatment.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin Lick, who was released in a prisoner exchange, stands on the sidelines of a press conference organized by the Foundation Against Corruption in Bonn, Germany, on August 2, 2024.\n\nChristoph Reichwein/dpa/AP\n\n\n\n            Lick was released in August as part of a major prisoner swap between Russia, the United States and other Western nations. Although it was the largest prisoner swap since the Cold War, the detainees freed account for less than 2% of the total number of political prisoners held in prisons in Russia.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPSHOT - A portrait of Russian President Vladimir Putin is seen on a page of a new schoolbook for high school students on general world history and Russian history, mentioning the the country's ongoing military action in Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea in 2014, during its presentation in Moscow on August 7, 2023.

And we must ensure that this feature is not stolen by the government.”\n    \n\n            Addressing young Russians, he urges them to resist conscription. “If they are going to enlist you in the military, just don’t go. In my opinion, it is better to go to prison than being a killing machine in Ukraine.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nArseny Turbin is pictured via videolink ahead of his appeal hearing on November 7. His mother, Irina Turbina, attended the court session on the outskirts of Moscow.\n\nIrina Turbina\n\n\n\n            While conditions in detention are supposed to be slightly more lenient for teenagers than for adults, juvenile penal colonies can in fact be even harsher due to the chaotic and violent environment among young inmates, said Davidis, of Memorial.\n    \n\n            Davidis believes young people are pursued for prosecution by the state because they are seen as less intimidated by government authority, less influenced by propaganda, and more likely to act against perceived unfairness.\n    \n\n            While independent Russian media have covered Turbin’s case in detail, state media outlets have not – perhaps because much of the proceedings has been held behind closed doors.\n    \n\n            “Unfortunately, usually we do not have access to the cases, to the details of their cases,” Davidis said, with the state citing privacy concerns because they involve minors.\n    \n\n            Other experts, among them Nina Khrushcheva, professor of international affairs at the New School and great-granddaughter of former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, point to the country’s long history of using fear and indoctrination to maintain control.\n    \n\n            The Russian state seeks to shape citizens’ views starting in early childhood, Khrushcheva said. “Because they think from a young age, if you brainwashed them the right way, then at the age of 16, they say ‘wonderful, Putin is great.’”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis picture, drawn by Alexey Moskalyov's then-12-year-old daughter, attracted the attention of school authorities. He was fined and then imprisoned for his own online posts critical of the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMemorial in English\n\n\n\n        Jailed after child’s anti-war drawing\n\n\n            When children are too young to face prosecution under Russian law, it’s not unknown for a parent to bear the brunt. Such was the case for entrepreneur and single father Alexey Moskalyov, who was sentenced to nearly two years in prison for “discrediting the Russian army” on social media.\n    \n\n            The charges against him came shortly after his then-12-year-old daughter, Masha, drew an anti-war picture in April 2022, two months into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The drawing featured a Russian flag with the words “No to war,” a Ukrainian flag with the inscription “Glory to Ukraine,” and a woman shielding her child from missiles fired from Russia. The picture drew the attention of school authorities; Moskalyov was initially fined and then incarcerated for his own online posts critical of the war, while Masha was temporarily put in an orphanage.\n    \n\n            Released in October, Moskalyov emerged from prison gaunt and wearing a thin, faded prison uniform. Video footage showed him embracing his tearful daughter.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlexey Moskalyov hugs his daughter Masha after he was released from prison on October 15. He was sentenced to nearly two years for “discrediting the Russian army” on social media.\n\nOVD-Info\n\n\n\n            “The conditions were… there are no words to describe it. It was simply a torture chamber,” he said, recounting the brutal experience. Held in a tiny cell, sometimes shared with another prisoner or rats from the sewers, he had to spend 16 hours a day on his feet in frigid temperatures.\n    \n\n            The harsh conditions in Russian prisons have taken a toll on prisoners of conscience, with some losing their lives, like the late opposition leader Alexey Navalny.\n    \n\n            Reflecting on the fate of the opposition leader her 16-year-old son so looked up to, Turbina struggles to imagine what kind of bleak future Arseny might be facing.\n    \n\n            “God forbid… repeating Alexey Navalny’s fate. It’s just beyond… (words). In this case… it will probably be impossible to survive,” she said, her voice trembling before she paused to regain her composure.\n    \n\n            She hopes, as a child, her son will receive some protection. And, for now, she has a message for Arseny: “We need to accept what is happening, not give up hope and keep fighting.”\n    \n\n  CNN’s Oscar Featherstone and Michael Conte contributed to this report.",

In the fall of 2023, Russia’s financial monitoring agency designated Turbin as a “terrorist and extremist” on its official list. ﻿Then this summer, on June 20, came the sentencing.\n    \n\n            Turbina is deeply fearful of the toll the penitentiary system may take on her son. “I’m terrified for him,” she confided to CNN. “I’m worried how he will spend these years and whether part of him will break. I want to believe that he will be strong until the end and will pass the test with dignity. But he is still just a child after all, and what if, at some point, some circumstances might break him?”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn excerpt from another letter sent by Arseny Turbin to his mother, and shared with CNN, describes tough conditions in detention.\n\nIllustration by Leah Abucayan/CNN\n\n\n\n            Arseny’s is not an isolated case. Russian law permits the prosecution of children as young as 14 for serious crimes, including terrorism and treason — broad charges increasingly pursued against young people since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, said Sergei Davidis, who heads the Political Prisoners Support Program at Memorial Human Rights Center.\n    \n\n            This reflects a broader escalation in Moscow’s crackdown on dissent, which began before the war but has intensified since February 2022. Since then, at least 20,070 people have been detained for anti-war views, and 9,369 cases of “discrediting the army” have been recorded, relating to actions including social media posts or wearing clothes with Ukrainian flag symbols, said Dmitry Anisimov, spokesperson for OVD-Info.\n    \n\n            Parents and caregivers have also been targeted through harassment, arbitrary arrests, and even threats of losing custody of their children, according to independent monitoring organizations such as OVD-Info and Memorial.\n    \n\n            The Kremlin consistently denies the existence of political prisoners in Russia, claiming all incarcerations are based on legal violations, despite human rights organizations indicating otherwise.\n    \n\n        ‘Not just statistics’\n\n\n            Kevin Lick, a 19-year-old dual Russian-German citizen, knows the price of dissent in modern Russia all too well. Arrested at 17, a year after the war in Ukraine began, he was sentenced to serve four years in a penal colony, becoming the youngest person in modern Russian history ever to be convicted of state treason.\n    \n\n            Prosecutors accused him of photographing military objects with the intent to share them with foreign intelligence – claims Lick denies.\n    \n\n            During his imprisonment, the teenager says he was put in solitary confinement, endured physical abuse and brutal prison conditions. “Looking back, of course, it left scars,” he said, acknowledging his ongoing struggle with PTSD.\n    \n\n            Russian authorities have not publicly addressed the claims, nor has Russia’s Federal Penitentiary Service responded to CNN’s request for comment regarding allegations that teenagers in detention have suffered violence and mistreatment.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin Lick, who was released in a prisoner exchange, stands on the sidelines of a press conference organized by the Foundation Against Corruption in Bonn, Germany, on August 2, 2024.\n\nChristoph Reichwein/dpa/AP\n\n\n\n            Lick was released in August as part of a major prisoner swap between Russia, the United States and other Western nations. Although it was the largest prisoner swap since the Cold War, the detainees freed account for less than 2% of the total number of political prisoners held in prisons in Russia.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPSHOT - A portrait of Russian President Vladimir Putin is seen on a page of a new schoolbook for high school students on general world history and Russian history, mentioning the the country's ongoing military action in Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea in 2014, during its presentation in Moscow on August 7, 2023.

And we must ensure that this feature is not stolen by the government.”\n    \n\n            Addressing young Russians, he urges them to resist conscription. “If they are going to enlist you in the military, just don’t go. In my opinion, it is better to go to prison than being a killing machine in Ukraine.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nArseny Turbin is pictured via videolink ahead of his appeal hearing on November 7. His mother, Irina Turbina, attended the court session on the outskirts of Moscow.\n\nIrina Turbina\n\n\n\n            While conditions in detention are supposed to be slightly more lenient for teenagers than for adults, juvenile penal colonies can in fact be even harsher due to the chaotic and violent environment among young inmates, said Davidis, of Memorial.\n    \n\n            Davidis believes young people are pursued for prosecution by the state because they are seen as less intimidated by government authority, less influenced by propaganda, and more likely to act against perceived unfairness.\n    \n\n            While independent Russian media have covered Turbin’s case in detail, state media outlets have not – perhaps because much of the proceedings has been held behind closed doors.\n    \n\n            “Unfortunately, usually we do not have access to the cases, to the details of their cases,” Davidis said, with the state citing privacy concerns because they involve minors.\n    \n\n            Other experts, among them Nina Khrushcheva, professor of international affairs at the New School and great-granddaughter of former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, point to the country’s long history of using fear and indoctrination to maintain control.\n    \n\n            The Russian state seeks to shape citizens’ views starting in early childhood, Khrushcheva said. “Because they think from a young age, if you brainwashed them the right way, then at the age of 16, they say ‘wonderful, Putin is great.’”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis picture, drawn by Alexey Moskalyov's then-12-year-old daughter, attracted the attention of school authorities. He was fined and then imprisoned for his own online posts critical of the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMemorial in English\n\n\n\n        Jailed after child’s anti-war drawing\n\n\n            When children are too young to face prosecution under Russian law, it’s not unknown for a parent to bear the brunt. Such was the case for entrepreneur and single father Alexey Moskalyov, who was sentenced to nearly two years in prison for “discrediting the Russian army” on social media.\n    \n\n            The charges against him came shortly after his then-12-year-old daughter, Masha, drew an anti-war picture in April 2022, two months into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The drawing featured a Russian flag with the words “No to war,” a Ukrainian flag with the inscription “Glory to Ukraine,” and a woman shielding her child from missiles fired from Russia. The picture drew the attention of school authorities; Moskalyov was initially fined and then incarcerated for his own online posts critical of the war, while Masha was temporarily put in an orphanage.\n    \n\n            Released in October, Moskalyov emerged from prison gaunt and wearing a thin, faded prison uniform. Video footage showed him embracing his tearful daughter.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlexey Moskalyov hugs his daughter Masha after he was released from prison on October 15.

It was simply a torture chamber,” he said, recounting the brutal experience. Held in a tiny cell, sometimes shared with another prisoner or rats from the sewers, he had to spend 16 hours a day on his feet in frigid temperatures.\n    \n\n            The harsh conditions in Russian prisons have taken a toll on prisoners of conscience, with some losing their lives, like the late opposition leader Alexey Navalny.\n    \n\n            Reflecting on the fate of the opposition leader her 16-year-old son so looked up to, Turbina struggles to imagine what kind of bleak future Arseny might be facing.\n    \n\n            “God forbid… repeating Alexey Navalny’s fate. It’s just beyond… (words). In this case… it will probably be impossible to survive,” she said, her voice trembling before she paused to regain her composure.\n    \n\n            She hopes, as a child, her son will receive some protection. And, for now, she has a message for Arseny: “We need to accept what is happening, not give up hope and keep fighting.”\n    \n\n  CNN’s Oscar Featherstone and Michael Conte contributed to this report.",

Authorities had waited until he was in custody in Pinellas County to notify her family.\n    \n\n            Peca was in disbelief when she got the call Friday from detective Brian Bilbrey of the St. Petersburg Police Department. Overwhelmed with emotion, she excused herself to gather her thoughts.\n    \n\n            “I can’t explain the feeling I had that moment. It was the combination of happiness and pain,” she said at a news conference Tuesday. “I remember going like, ‘Oh my God, oh my God! Are you sure?’ I was going back and forth around the house.”\n    \n\n            For Peca and her family, the arrest was a glimmer of hope after more than three years of heartbreak and uncertainty. Police said Williams shot Joana Peca in the face on July 31, 2021, as she sat in the driver’s seat of her parked van at a St. Petersburg cemetery.\n    \n\n            She was holding her four-month-old boy in her arms when it happened, police said. Her older son, then 4, witnessed the shooting from the backseat. Peca was Williams’ ex-girlfriend, and the younger child is his, authorities said.\n    \n\n            In past interviews, Eleni Peca had recounted the 4-year-old’s desperate efforts to save his mother. When she picked the children up from the police station that day, she said the boy told her, “I tried to clean blood on her face, but my hands was too small … she had a lot of blood coming out and I couldn’t help my mommy.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoana Peca in an undated photo. She was 27.\n\nSt. Petersburg Police Department\n\n\n\n            Williams, 41, has been charged with first-degree murder and two counts of child abuse and is being held without bond in the Pinellas County Jail. Information on whether he has retained an attorney was not immediately available.\n    \n\n            Joana Peca was 27. Her mother, who has custody of her grandchildren, said she lost a piece of herself when her daughter died. She’s said she’s still grieving Joana’s death, along with the loss of all the dreams she had for her.\n    \n\n            “Benjamin Williams decided to take the life of my only child in front of those kids,” Peca said this week after his arrest. “Benjamin Williams’ freedom is over.”\n    \n\n        He lured his ex to the cemetery under false pretenses, her mother says\n\n\n            The shooting happened after Williams persuaded Peca to meet him at a St. Petersburg cemetery so he could see his infant son, authorities said. Williams’ sister is buried there, so Joana Peca trusted his intentions, her mother said.\n    \n\n            As she sat in the front seat of her van holding the baby, he walked up to the car and shot her several times, St. Petersburg Police Chief Anthony Holloway said.\n\n\n            “Witnesses rushed to the scene to see if they could help Joana. And as they moved her forward, … they realized that she was still holding a four-month-old baby,” he said. “Thankfully, none of the children were hurt,” Holloway added. “But I can’t even imagine the emotional toll that this four-year-old is facing today.”\n    \n\n            Williams vanished after the shooting, authorities said. The St. Petersburg police teamed up with US Marshals, Crime Stoppers and other federal authorities to search for him, and a $25,000 reward was issued for information leading to his arrest.\n    \n\n            The TV show “In Pursuit with John Walsh” featured the unsolved killing in an episode that aired in November 2022. The episode described a scar on Williams’ nose and said he is missing two top teeth and sometimes wears disguises, including female clothes.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEleni Peca speaks at a news conference Tuesday in St. Petersburg, Florida.\n\nSt. Petersburg Police Department\n\n\n\n            Major David Gerardo of St. Petersburg Police said on the show that officers found no gun at the scene and it was not immediately clear who had killed Peca. But clues emerged after investigators went through her cell phone and discovered that she had planned to meet Williams that day, he said. \n\n\n            During Williams’ time on the run he was captured on security video at a store in Georgia wearing a T-shirt with “World’s Best Dad” written on it, authorities said.\n    \n\n        A TikTok post from three years ago helped identify him\n\n\n            Months turned into years, with no sign of Williams.\n    \n\n            Then on November 27, someone in Mexico saw a TikTok video about the case and tipped the US Embassy and Crime Stoppers that Williams was living in Mexico City, authorities said.\n    \n\n            The video was posted about 10 days after the shooting by Jasmeen Alexander, a TikTok influencer whose true-crime account now has more than 2.8 million followers. It shows a Florida news channel’s coverage of the killing and search for the suspect, and has been shared hundreds of times.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice cordon off the crime scene where Peca was shot in July 2021.\n\nWFTS\n\n\n\n            It also includes a photo of Williams — in a buzz cut — staring back at the camera.Williams was often on the move in Mexico City, where he was living under a fake name and close to being homeless, said Yolanda Fernandez, a police spokesperson. She declined to provide additional details, citing an ongoing investigation.\n    \n\n            In his recent arrest photo, Williams’ hair is in long dreadlocks and a scar on his nose is clearly visible. He was extradited to Miami, where a St. Petersburg detective and a Pinellas County sheriff’s deputy picked him up over the weekend.\n    \n\n            “A dangerous criminal no longer poses a threat to the community, and most importantly to the family — because they were nervous he was going to come back and try to harm the family,” said Holloway, who described Williams as St. Petersburg’s most wanted criminal.\n    \n\n            Before his arrest, witnesses in the case were terrified to come forward, but that will change now that Williams is in custody, Holloway said.\n    \n\n            At the news conference he also addressed Peca’s family directly.\n    \n\n            “Nothing can replace the loss of your daughter, but at least we have a dangerous person off the street,” he said. “At least a loving mother … and the family can know now that we have him in custody.

        "content": "New York\nCNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            A federal judge on Thursday rejected a plea agreement between Boeing and the US government after the company said it would plead guilty to deceiving the Federal Aviation Administration ahead of two fatal 737 Max crashes.\n    \n\n            The rejection by US District Court Judge Reed O’Connor citied his problems with the selection process for a independent monitor required in the plea deal to oversee safety and quality improvement at Boeing.\n    \n\n            Boeing agreed in July to plead guilty to one charge of conspiracy to defraud the United States. Under the plea agreement it would pay up to $487 million in fines — a fraction of the $24.8 billion that families of victims of the two crashes want the company to pay.\n    \n\n            O’Connor had problems with the idea that the Justice Department, not the court, would have approval over the selection of the monitor and how Boeing had performed under an earlier settlement with the Justice Department in January 2021 over the same charges. That agreement had deferred prosecution until the safety issues were again raised by a door plug blowing off a 737 Max plane flown by Alaska Airlines in January.\n    \n\n            “It is fair to say the government’s attempt to ensure compliance has failed,” O’Connor wrote in his opinion. “At this point, the public interest requires the court to step in. Marginalizing the court in the selection and monitoring of the independent monitor as the plea agreement does undermines public confidence in Boeing’s probation.”\n    \n\n            One of O’Connor’s problems with the plea agreement was that the Justice Department had said Boeing and Justice would have to consider race when hiring the independent monitor. But he also was upset that the court did not have a role in the selection process.\n    \n\n            The families argued that the amount of the fine amounted to a sweetheart deal for Boeing, letting it off the hook for the two fatal crashes that were caused by a design flaw on the planes. They argue that Boeing’s previous profits on every plane sold would allow for a much larger fine than the one the Justice Department argues it can justify under the plea agreement.\n    \n\n            “Rejection of the plea deal is an important victory of the families in this case and, more broadly, crime victims’ interests in the criminal justice process,” said Paul Cassell, attorney for family members of crash victims, in a statement. “No longer can federal prosecutors and high-powered defense attorney craft backroom deals and just expect judges to approve them. Victims can object – and when they have good reasons for striking a plea, judges will response.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Boeing 737 MAX 8 is pictured outside the factory on March 11, 2019 in Renton, Washington.\n\nStephen Brashear/Getty Images\n\n\n\nvideo\n          \n\n\nRelated video\n‘She didn’t know the plane was dangerous.’ Why families are angry about Boeing’s plea deal\n\n\n\n\n            “This order should lead to a significant renegotiation of the plea deal to reflect the 346 deaths Boeing criminally caused and put in place proper monitoring of Boeing to ensure that it never again commits a crime like this in the future,” he added.\n    \n\n            However it’s not clear that the families of the crash victims will be happier with any future plea agreement, said Todd Haugh, professor of business law and ethics at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business. Any new plea agreement will be negotiated by the Justice Department in the incoming Trump administration and Boeing, not under the Biden administration. And it was the Trump administration’s Justice Department that originally reached a settlement with Boeing weeks before leaving office that deferred prosecution, allowed Boeing to pay a smaller fine and could have let the company eventually avoid a guilty plea or conviction on its record.\n    \n\n            This could be a “be careful what you wish for” situation for the families, Haugh said.\n    \n\n            Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n    \n\n            Under the July plea agreement Boeing also agreed to spend $455 million on its compliance and safety programs over the next three years, which the government said would represent a 75% increase over what the company was spending annually on those programs.\n    \n\n            But the biggest change under the plea agreement was that Boeing agreed to operate under the supervision of a government-appointed monitor for a period of three years to make sure it improved the quality and safety of its aircraft.\n    \n\n            The plea represented yet another black eye for the company after a series problems, ranging from embarrassing to tragic, for the company over the last six years. And it was a severe blow to the reputation of Boeing, a company once known for the quality and safety of its commercial aircraft.\n    \n\n            According to the charges, the company defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration during the process of certifying the 737 Max to carry its first passengers.\n    \n\n            The plane started service in 2017, but the two fatal crashes – in October 2018 and March of 2019 – led to a 20-month grounding of the jets, and investigations revealed a design flaw in its autopilot system. Boeing has admitted responsibility for the fatal crashes, and that its employees withheld information about the design flaw from the FAA during certification.\n    \n\n            “Boeing profoundly regrets the accidents and the unspeakable losses that the crash victim representatives have suffered,” attorneys for the company said in an August filing in the case. “Boeing, for its part, has accepted responsibility for the Max crashes, publicly and in civil litigation, because the design of (a feature on the Max) contributed to those accidents.”\n    \n\n            But Boeing argued in the filing that the misleading information it has admitted giving to the FAA during the certification process did not itself cause the crash.\n    \n\n            And in its own filing in August, the Justice Department essentially agreed with that argument from Boeing.\n    \n\n            “Yet in the end… (DOJ officials have) not found the one thing that underlies the families’ most passionate objections to the proposed resolution: evidence that could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Boeing’s fraud caused the deaths of their loved ones,” said the Justice Department’s filing in support of the plea agreement.\n    \n\nThis story has been updated with additional context and developments.",

Under the plea agreement it would pay up to $487 million in fines — a fraction of the $24.8 billion that families of victims of the two crashes want the company to pay.\n    \n\n            O’Connor had problems with the idea that the Justice Department, not the court, would have approval over the selection of the monitor and how Boeing had performed under an earlier settlement with the Justice Department in January 2021 over the same charges. That agreement had deferred prosecution until the safety issues were again raised by a door plug blowing off a 737 Max plane flown by Alaska Airlines in January.\n    \n\n            “It is fair to say the government’s attempt to ensure compliance has failed,” O’Connor wrote in his opinion. “At this point, the public interest requires the court to step in. Marginalizing the court in the selection and monitoring of the independent monitor as the plea agreement does undermines public confidence in Boeing’s probation.”\n    \n\n            One of O’Connor’s problems with the plea agreement was that the Justice Department had said Boeing and Justice would have to consider race when hiring the independent monitor. But he also was upset that the court did not have a role in the selection process.\n    \n\n            The families argued that the amount of the fine amounted to a sweetheart deal for Boeing, letting it off the hook for the two fatal crashes that were caused by a design flaw on the planes. They argue that Boeing’s previous profits on every plane sold would allow for a much larger fine than the one the Justice Department argues it can justify under the plea agreement.\n    \n\n            “Rejection of the plea deal is an important victory of the families in this case and, more broadly, crime victims’ interests in the criminal justice process,” said Paul Cassell, attorney for family members of crash victims, in a statement. “No longer can federal prosecutors and high-powered defense attorney craft backroom deals and just expect judges to approve them. Victims can object – and when they have good reasons for striking a plea, judges will response.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Boeing 737 MAX 8 is pictured outside the factory on March 11, 2019 in Renton, Washington.\n\nStephen Brashear/Getty Images\n\n\n\nvideo\n          \n\n\nRelated video\n‘She didn’t know the plane was dangerous.’ Why families are angry about Boeing’s plea deal\n\n\n\n\n            “This order should lead to a significant renegotiation of the plea deal to reflect the 346 deaths Boeing criminally caused and put in place proper monitoring of Boeing to ensure that it never again commits a crime like this in the future,” he added.\n    \n\n            However it’s not clear that the families of the crash victims will be happier with any future plea agreement, said Todd Haugh, professor of business law and ethics at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business. Any new plea agreement will be negotiated by the Justice Department in the incoming Trump administration and Boeing, not under the Biden administration. And it was the Trump administration’s Justice Department that originally reached a settlement with Boeing weeks before leaving office that deferred prosecution, allowed Boeing to pay a smaller fine and could have let the company eventually avoid a guilty plea or conviction on its record.\n    \n\n            This could be a “be careful what you wish for” situation for the families, Haugh said.\n    \n\n            Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n    \n\n            Under the July plea agreement Boeing also agreed to spend $455 million on its compliance and safety programs over the next three years, which the government said would represent a 75% increase over what the company was spending annually on those programs.\n    \n\n            But the biggest change under the plea agreement was that Boeing agreed to operate under the supervision of a government-appointed monitor for a period of three years to make sure it improved the quality and safety of its aircraft.\n    \n\n            The plea represented yet another black eye for the company after a series problems, ranging from embarrassing to tragic, for the company over the last six years. And it was a severe blow to the reputation of Boeing, a company once known for the quality and safety of its commercial aircraft.\n    \n\n            According to the charges, the company defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration during the process of certifying the 737 Max to carry its first passengers.\n    \n\n            The plane started service in 2017, but the two fatal crashes – in October 2018 and March of 2019 – led to a 20-month grounding of the jets, and investigations revealed a design flaw in its autopilot system. Boeing has admitted responsibility for the fatal crashes, and that its employees withheld information about the design flaw from the FAA during certification.\n    \n\n            “Boeing profoundly regrets the accidents and the unspeakable losses that the crash victim representatives have suffered,” attorneys for the company said in an August filing in the case. “Boeing, for its part, has accepted responsibility for the Max crashes, publicly and in civil litigation, because the design of (a feature on the Max) contributed to those accidents.”\n    \n\n            But Boeing argued in the filing that the misleading information it has admitted giving to the FAA during the certification process did not itself cause the crash.\n    \n\n            And in its own filing in August, the Justice Department essentially agreed with that argument from Boeing.\n    \n\n            “Yet in the end… (DOJ officials have) not found the one thing that underlies the families’ most passionate objections to the proposed resolution: evidence that could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Boeing’s fraud caused the deaths of their loved ones,” said the Justice Department’s filing in support of the plea agreement.\n    \n\nThis story has been updated with additional context and developments.",

        "title": "LA Times owner plans to add AI-powered ‘bias meter’ on news stories, sparking newsroom backlash",
        "content": "New York\nCNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            Los Angeles Times owner Patrick Soon-Shiong, who blocked the newspaper’s endorsement of Kamala Harris and plans to overhaul its editorial board, says he will implement an artificial intelligence-powered “bias meter” on the paper’s news articles to provide readers with “both sides” of a story.\n    \n\n            Soon-Shiong, the biotech billionaire who acquired the Times in 2018, told CNN political commentator Scott Jennings — who will join the Times’ editorial board — that he’s been “quietly building” an AI meter “behind the scenes.” The meter, slated to be released in January, is powered by the same augmented intelligence technology that he’s been building since 2010 for health care purposes, Soon-Shiong said.\n    \n\n            “Somebody could understand as they read it that the source of the article has some level of bias,” he said on Jennings’ “Flyover Country,” podcast. “And what we need to do is not have what we call confirmation bias and then that story automatically, the reader can press a button and get both sides of that exact same story based on that story and then give comments.”\n    \n\n            Soon-Shiong said major publishers have so far failed to adequately separate news and opinion, which he suggested “could be the downfall of what now people call mainstream media.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump attends a campaign rally in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, U.S., October 30, 2024.\n\nBrendan McDermid/Reuters\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nDonald Trump weaponizes non-endorsements from The Washington Post and Los Angeles Times\n\n\n\n\n            The comments prompted a rebuke from the union representing hundreds of the Times’ newsroom staffers, which said Soon-Shiong had “publicly suggested his staff harbors bias, without offering evidence or examples.”\n    \n\n            “Our members — and all Times staffers — abide by a strict set of ethics guidelines, which call for fairness, precision, transparency, vigilance against bias, and an earnest search to understand all sides of an issue,” the Los Angeles Times Guild said in a statement Thursday. “Those longstanding principles will continue guiding our work.”\n    \n\n            The contentious moves from the paper’s owner also led to the resignation of Harry Litman, a senior legal affairs columnist for the Times’ Opinion page.\n    \n\n            “My resignation is a protest and visceral reaction against the conduct of the paper’s owner, Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong. Soon-Shiong has made several moves to force the paper, over the forceful objections of his staff, into a posture more sympathetic to Donald Trump,” Litman wrote Thursday. “Given the existential stakes for our democracy that I believe Trump’s second term poses, and the evidence that Soon-Shiong is currying favor with the President-elect, they are repugnant and dangerous.”\n    \n\n            Litman’s resignation comes days after Kerry Cavanaugh, the Times’ assistant editorial page editor, also announced her exit, Status first reported. In addition to his sweeping changes to the editorial board, a person familiar with the matter said Soon-Shiong has begun reviewing the headlines of all opinion pieces before publication. A spokesperson for the Times did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n    \n\n            The moves come as Soon-Shiong looks to restructure the newspaper’s editorial board, telling CNN last month that he plans to balance the paper’s opinion section with more conservative and centrist voices in the wake of President-elect Donald Trump’s victory.\n    \n\n            “If we were honest with ourselves, our current board of opinion writers veered very left, which is fine, but I think in order to have balance, you also need to have somebody who would trend right, and more importantly, somebody that would trend in the middle,” Soon-Shiong told CNN in November.\n    \n\n            The restructuring follows Soon-Shiong’s divisive decision to block a drafted endorsement of Vice President Harris two weeks before Election Day, which resulted in the resignation of several members of the paper’s editorial board, staff protests, and thousands of readers canceling their subscriptions. Just three of the editorial board’s eight members now remain, according to the Times website. On Wednesday, Soon-Shiong told Jennings that when the editorial board shared it had “pre-packaged” a presidential endorsement “without having met with any of the candidates,” he was “outraged.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeff Bezos speaks onstage during The New York Times Dealbook Summit 2024 on Dec. 4, in New York.\n\nEugene Gologursky/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nJeff Bezos says he will try to talk Trump out of idea that the news media is an ‘enemy’\n\n\n\n\n            “I did not want our paper to be part of that method of providing information or misinformation or disinformation,” he said.\n    \n\n            “Everybody has a right to an opinion, that’s fair,” Soon-Shiong said, underscoring that the paper needs to “actually create some level of balance when it comes to opinion and columnist, and then we need to actually let the reader know this is opinion.”\n    \n\n            In his resignation Thursday, Litman called the owner’s decision to spike the presidential endorsement a “deep insult to the paper’s readership.”\n    \n\n            “Trump has made it clear that he will make trouble for media outlets that cross him,” Litman wrote. “Rather than reacting with indignation at this challenge to his paper’s critical function in a democracy, Soon-Shiong threw the paper to the wolves. That was cowardly.”",

        "title": "Streaming site Twitch is embroiled in controversy over creators’ content about its handling of Israel and Palestine",
        "content": "New York\nCNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            Creators on Twitch have waded into controversy over Israel’s war in Gaza in recent months, spooking advertisers and brands who have pulled away or otherwise admonished the Amazon-owned livestreaming platform.\n    \n\n            JPMorgan Chase pulled out of Twitch advertising in the last couple of months, a source said, though it was part of a broader strategy of brand safety and worries about what content was showing up near their ads. Antisemitism allegations went into those considerations.\n    \n\n            Chevron, a sponsor of Twitch’s semi-annual convention, TwitchCon, expressed disappointment with Twitch in a statement to CNN after controversial comments were made during a TwitchCon panel of Middle Eastern streamers.\n    \n\n            At least two other companies, AT&T and Dunkin’ Donuts, also pulled out of advertising on the platform, according to Bloomberg. Twitch told CNN it does not comment on advertisers.\n    \n\n            The controversy at Twitch underscores how hard it is to deal with sensitive political topics that have become commonly discussed and shared on social media.\n    \n\n            “There is no place on Twitch for racism, hatred, or harassment of any kind, including antisemitism and Islamophobia,” Twitch CEO Dan Clancy wrote in a November blog post, adding that Twitch works “hard to ensure that our community is a safe place.”\n    \n\n            Hasan Piker, who goes by HasanAbi to his 2.8 million Twitch subscribers, has been described as the left’s Joe Rogan.\n    \n\n            Rep. Ritchie Torres of New York wrote a letter to Twitch last month “concerning antisemitic and anti-American propaganda emanating from Hasan Piker, one of Twitch’s largest online streamers.”\n    \n\n            In the letter, Torres wrote: “Mr. Piker has demonized Orthodox Jews as ‘inbred’ and has dehumanized a Jewish man as a ‘bloodthirsty pig dog.’” Piker told NBC News last month that the videos cited in the letter were taken out of context and he was criticizing the Israeli government, not Jewish people.\n    \n\n            “I’ve been an outspoken advocate for Palestinian emancipation for the past 10 years, professionally in my media career,” he said in an interview with Wired in August. When asked about antisemitic allegations in an interview with CNN, he said: “Of course not. The real problem here is that I’m anti-Zionist. The real problem here is that I’m extremely critical of Israel.”\n    \n\n            A campaign to pressure advertisers to pull out of Twitch was led by supporters of Dan “DanCantStream” Saltman and people in spaces linked to Steven “Destiny” Bonnell. Saltman has criticized and targeted Piker, and Saltman told DigiDay his campaign’s group had reached out to over 100 advertisers already.\n    \n\n            In a response to a Bloomberg journalist’s questions, he said “The goal of our campaign is simple: The CEO, Dan Clancy stepping down.” He also said “My ban from Twitch was ceremonial at best – I was in the process of deleting my account when the ban went into place.”\n    \n\n            Both have been suspended from Twitch for different reasons; Saltman for harassment rules and Destiny for hateful conduct. Many of their fans online on forums such as Reddit want them reinstated.\n    \n\n            Saltman claims his ban was likely to prevent him from speaking to other streamers about issues on the platform.\n    \n\n            “When a major media company such as Twitch encourages, promotes and protects virulent antisemitism on its platform, it’s prudent for advertisers to be aware of what spaces they are supporting,” Saltman said in the letter.\n    \n\n            However, critics allege the some of those campaigning against antisemitism are not acting in good faith.\n    \n\n            Critics have accused Saltman, Destiny and their supporters or those associated with them of targeting and harassing female journalists and Twitch employees, actions that violate Twitch’s policy.\n    \n\n        Controversy over streamers\n\n\n            Comments made at the “Ayyrabs Podcast” panel, hosted by Twitch partner and streamer Frogan at TwitchCon, are at the center of the controversy. The in-person event is dedicated to the platform, its creators and users and took place in September.\n    \n\n            Twitch suspended those panelists, as well as separately an account for user Asmongold, after he made racist remarks about Palestinians. It was not specified to CNN how long each suspension was.\n    \n\n            At the panel, when the panelists were ranking how “Arab” other streamers were, the lowest category on the board was “Loves Sabra.” Sabra, a hummus brand that was previously partially owned by Israeli food company The Strauss Group, was fully acquired by PepsiCo in November. Sabra is often part of pro-Palestinian boycotts.\n    \n\n            The background of the panel featured logos from Chevron, Samsung and Capcom.\n    \n\n            In a statement to CNN, Chevron said the “derogatory comments” made on stage were “deeply hurtful” and expressed disappointment in Twitch organizers.\n    \n\n            “As an event sponsor, Chevron relied on conference organizers to exercise stringent oversight of presentations and content, and we are disappointed that such divisive rhetoric was allowed onstage,” a spokesperson said Wednesday. The company said it reviews its sponsorships and advertisements “periodically.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA view of the opening ceremony stage at TwitchCon 2024 San Diego on September 20, 2024 in San Diego, California.\n\nRobin L Marshall/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            In October, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a pro-Israel and Jewish advocacy group that works to combat anti-Semitism, said it spoke with Twitch staff a month after TwitchCon.\n    \n\n            “Twitch must learn from this situation and improve how they address antisemitism and hate on their platform, which is an ongoing and significant challenge,” the ADL said in a statement on X. The ADL said it was not in touch with any advertisers.\n    \n\n            One online commentator, Ethan Klein, who was featured on the board as someone who “Loves Sabra,” posted in a video alleging that the messaging of the panel was “kinda Arab good, Jew bad.”\n    \n\n            On X, Frogan said she was banned from Twitch for 30 days, posting a screengrab citing “targeted hateful conduct.”\n    \n\n            She also said the “habibi pass” list was a “meme tier list,” essentially equating it to an online joke in a format that’s popular online. (“Habibi” is Arabic for beloved; a “habibi pass” means someone who can use the word in line with its meaning.)\n    \n\n            “The whole basis of my podcast ayyrabs with capri and raff is that we are all arabs from different religious backgrounds - i am muslim, capri is christian, and raff is jewish,” she said, referring to the suspended hosts of the podcast who were also part of the panel.\n    \n\n            In October, Frogan posted that her suspension was longer than user Asmongold, whose real name is Zack Hoyt. His main channel on Twitch is popular with 3.6 million followers. While Frogan’s comments, which were made with sponsors clearly displayed in the backdrop behind her, caused a 30 day ban, she said Hoyt’s tirade against Palestinians got two weeks. Twitch did not confirm the lengths of the suspensions.\n    \n\n            Earlier this year, he called the victims of Israel’s military campaign, who number at least 44,502 according to the local health ministry, “terrible people” adding that they come from an “inferior culture.”\n    \n\n            “If you want to consider it genocide as a systematic killing of a group of people, they have genocide built into Sharia law right now,” Asmongold said in the viral clip. “So no, I’m not going to cry a f**king river when people who have genocide that’s baked into their laws are getting genocided. I don’t give a f**k. They’re terrible people. It’s not even a question. It’s crazy that people don’t see it that way. They’d be doing the same thing.”\n    \n\n            Asmongold later posted an apology on X in October, saying “Looking back on it, I was way too much of an a**hole about the Palestine thing. My bad.” In a follow-up video on YouTube, he said he “deserved” the repercussions and called his comments “disgusting.”\n    \n\n        Updating its policy\n\n\n            Twitch said it enforces its policies evenly.\n    \n\n            “Any and all content on Twitch must abide by our Community Guidelines, and we apply these rules objectively, to all of our creators. When we find content that breaks those rules, we take enforcement action,” the company said in a statement Wednesday.\n    \n\n            In November, Twitch updated its hateful content policy to include the term “Zionist” when using it “to attack or demean another individual or group of people on the basis of their background or religious belief.”\n    \n\n            The company acknowledged that Zionism refers to a political movement, and using the term in that context, whether in support or not, does not violate the policy.\n    \n\n            That same month, Twitch also requested streamers to use a new label, “Politics and Sensitive Social Issues,” on topics relating to those issues. Those labels help users choose what they want to consume on the site, and also for brands to have more control over where their ads appear, Twitch said.\n    \n\n            “Our goal isn’t to stifle conversation about or criticism of an institution or ideology, but to prevent coded hate directed at individuals and groups of people,” the company said in the policy.",

        "title": "Number of 401(k) ‘millionaires’ just jumped by 9.5%",
        "content": "CNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            A new analysis by Fidelity Investments, one of the largest providers of 401(k) retirement plans, found that the number of accounts with balances topping $1 million rose by 9.5% in the third quarter.\n    \n\n            All told, of the roughly 24 million participant accounts in the 401(k) plans for which Fidelity serves as record keeper, 544,000 of them had balances over $1 million, up from 497,000 in the second quarter.\n    \n\n            The average balance in that group was $1.616 million, up from $1.595 million in the prior quarter.\n    \n\n            Among Gen Xers — who are next in line for retirement — those who have been saving for at least 15 years had an average balance of just under $600,000, up 6% from the quarter before, according to Fidelity data.\n    \n\n            And it found that the average balance for all participants who were saving for five, 10 or 15 years rose during the quarter.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkers most at risk of not having saved enough for retirement are those without access to a work-based retirement plan, according to a recent analysis.\n\nDrazen_/E+/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nGen Xers are nearing retirement. Here’s why many are more at risk of running short of money than younger colleagues\n\n\n\n\n            The growth was due not just to market gains, but also a strong average savings rate of 14.1%, which includes employee contributions (9.4%) plus an employer match (4.7%).\n    \n\n            “We are continuing to observe a dedication to saving for retirement, with contributions to these vehicles holding steady if not increasing,” said Sharon Brovelli, president of Workplace Investing at Fidelity Investments. “Consistent retirement contributions during various market cycles is important … (since they) will help set Americans up for a future of financial wellness and security.”\n    \n\n            For many 401(k) participants, however, their balances are far below $1 million or even half that.\n    \n\n            The average balance for all participant accounts hit a record high, but it was still just $132,300, up 4% from $127,100 in the second quarter. And the median — which represents the level below which half of the accounts had lower balances — was just $30,600.\n    \n\n            Of course, these measures are taken across the accounts of people of all ages, income levels and tenures, so they include small balances from relatively new or young employees, who haven’t been saving in a company plan for long; as well as lower-income employees, who may not be able to save a lot regardless of age or tenure.\n    \n\n        A cure for cashing out\n\n\n            Those lower-income employees — who tend to be disproportionately minorities — may be among those most likely to cash out their 401(k) savings when they change jobs if their balances are small (e.g., under $7,000), instead of rolling the money over into their new employer’s plan or a tax-advantaged IRA.\n    \n\nCashing out is costly in a few ways: The distribution will be subject to income tax the year it’s taken; and if the person taking the money is under 59-1/2, then they will be hit with a 10% early withdrawal penalty too.\n    \n\n            And, over time, they will also lose out on the benefit of tax-deferred growth on that money had they left it invested without interruption.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you leave a job, it may be tempting to cash our your 401(k) to take care of more immediate needs. But consider the high cost of you'll pay for doing so by way of taxes, penalties and lost investment time.\n\nminiseries/E+/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nThe money you forfeit when you cash out of your 401(k) can be staggering\n\n\n\n\n            In its report, Fidelity highlighted the issue. And it noted that 6,000 of the 26,000 401(k)s for which it serves as record keeper now have an auto-portability feature, which provides an automatic rollover service for those with small balances.\n    \n\n            That kind of feature may become more common in the years ahead. To date, 6% of all plans have already implemented it or will do so soon, and nearly 26% are considering it, according to the Plan Sponsor Council of America.\n    \n\n            Making it easier to move small 401(k) balances from one plan to another throughout your career can pay off in the long term.\n    \n\n            If auto-portability were adopted widely, it could preserve an estimated $1.6 trillion in additional retirement savings over 40 years, including $744 billion for 98 million minority job-changers, according to the Portability Services Network, a consortium of leading workplace retirement plan record keepers like Fidelity, Vanguard, TIAA and Alight as well as the Retirement Clearinghouse.\n    \n\n            It was set up to help “under-served and under-saved workers” improve their retirement outcomes.",

        "content": "CNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            When Margo Martindale signed on to star in Prime Video’s new dark comedy series “The Sticky,” out Friday, she did not realize just how dramatic maple syrup could be.\n    \n\n            In fact, the “Cocaine Bear” star told CNN in a recent interview that when she learned that the Jamie Lee Curtis-produced series was inspired by a real-life heist from 2012 – one which involved the theft of $20 million worth of maple syrup from a Quebecois warehouse – Martindale at first found it hilarious.\n    \n\n            “I knew, honestly, almost nothing about maple syrup and I certainly didn’t know about the heist,” Martindale said. “When I found out that the heist was a real thing, I howled with laughter. That’s wild!”\n    \n\n            So when Curtis personally called Martindale and asked her to sign onto the series in the lead role, she had to say yes.\n    \n\n            “She was incredibly supportive in all of the beginnings of everything. She loves to give gifts. She loves to play. She’s a smart, strong force of nature,” Martindale said of Curtis, who also makes a wacky guest appearance in one delightfully chaotic episode.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJamie Lee Curtis in 'The Sticky.'\n\nJan Thijs/Amazon Studios\n\n\n\n            “The Sticky” veers a bit from the actual 2012 incident, which is made clear through a cheeky disclaimer at the start of each 30-minute episode that the show is “absolutely not the true story of the Great Canadian Maple Syrup Heist.”\n    \n\n            The six-episode series centers around Martindale’s character Ruth, a gritty maple syrup farmer in Quebec who is on the brink of losing her farm and has found herself at odds with the greedy head of the Association (the series’ fictionalized version of the Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers, a government-regulated organization) while she cares for her ailing, coma-bound husband.\n    \n\n            She teams up with Remy, a dopey security guard (Guillaume Cyr), and American wannabe mobster Mike (Chris Diamantopoulos) to drain the Association’s maple syrup reserve in a high-stakes heist.\n    \n\n            But Martindale doesn’t look at Ruth and her cohorts as criminals.\n    \n\n            “We’re only committing a crime because we’ve been pushed to the limit,” she said of her character’s predicament. “We’re committing a crime for the good of our families.”\n    \n\n            As the true tale of what’s been dubbed the “Great Canadian Maple Syrup Heist” goes, around 3,000 tons of maple syrup were slowly and quietly siphoned, barrel by barrel, from the Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers’ warehouse of reserves, Quebec police said in a statement at the time.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(From left) Guillaume Cyr, Margo Martindale and Chris Diamantopoulos in 'The Sticky.'\n\nJan Thijs/Amazon Studios\n\n\n\n            As much as 80% of the world’s maple syrup comes from the region, according to the Federation, which manages the world’s only strategic maple syrup reserve.\n    \n\n            The theft was discovered during a routine inventory check of the warehouse when officials realized that a significant amount of barrels originally containing the syrup were empty, concluding that it had been transferred to other containers during the heist.\n    \n\n            According to the Guardian, Quebec police arrested 16 people in connection with the crime at the time. Ringleader Richard Vallières, who intended to resell the stolen syrup in smaller batches for profit, was found guilty of fraud, trafficking and theft in 2016, and subsequently sentenced to eight years in prison.\n    \n\n            Vallières was also ordered to pay a $9 million dollar fine, which he has a decade to pay off, otherwise he may face an additional six years in prison, according to CBC.\n    \n\n            The incident was the subject of a 2018 episode of Netflix’s corporate greed and corruption docuseries “Dirty Money.”\n    \n\n            “People wanted to sell more of their maple syrup. Why couldn’t they? It was because it was government regulated, that’s why,” Martindale said. “That was fascinating to learn.”\n    \n\n            All six episodes of “The Sticky” are available to stream on Prime Video.",

        "content": "CNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            Every year, we Spotify users eagerly await Wrapped, the year-end roundup of our most-played artists and songs.\n    \n\n            And every year, at least in the last five, Spotify unleashes a new Wrapped feature so divisive that it threatens to eclipse the most popular music of the year.\n    \n\n            For its 2024 edition, Spotify Wrapped’s new gambit is “Your Music Evolution,” which assigns names to different “phases” of one’s listening habits. The phrases are largely nonsensical: “Wild west banjo outlaw country,” “theatrical potpourri Argentine rock,” “alien grind deathcore.” At least some of the words are genres.\n    \n\n            The “phases” were at least partly curated by “machine learning,” Spotify said, which linked descriptors with specific songs. The links it drew were somewhat tenuous, users argued.\n    \n\n            “Pink pilates princess” was a common refrain for listeners who marathoned the music of new pop royalty like Sabrina Carpenter, Charli XCX and Chappell Roan. “Pink” and “princess” both appear on Roan’s debut album, but the presence of “pilates” is puzzling. Alliterative rule of threes, perhaps.\n    \n\n            Some descriptions were truly inexplicable. “Vampire football rap”? (This, for listeners of artists like Travis Scott and Future, who are at least rappers.) Other bizarre phrases included riffs on “catwalk,” “sweater weather,” “mallgoth” and “pirate.” Even Frutiger Aero, a glossy aesthetic associated with the early 2000s Windows operating system, made it into Wrapped this year.\n    \n\n            Some brave souls dared share their “Music Evolutions” off Spotify. Semafor media editor Max Tani didn’t seem proud of his “pumpkin spice banjo indie folk” winter.\n    \n\n            “unbelievable how every year spotify manages to make listening to music - its core business - deeply embarrassing,” Tani wrote.\n    \n\n            The divisive reaction to “Your Music Evolution reminded others of last year’s Wrapped, in which users were assigned a “Sound Town,” a real place that shared their music taste. The experiment revealed little about its users, except that the residents of Burlington, Vermont, have a penchant for pop divas.",

The vehicle uses what NASA calls a “skip reentry” — acting like a rock skipping across the surface of a pond to slow its descent.\n    \n\n            Orion makes use of the maneuver “because the velocity of the spacecraft and the energy that it has to dissipate is much greater than the energy that you dissipate just coming back from low Earth orbit,” Melroy said.\n    \n\n            However, the problem arose when, as the Orion capsule was dipping in and out of the atmosphere during Artemis I’s return, “heat accumulated inside the heat shield’s outer layer” — causing the unexpected wear, according to Melroy.\n    \n\n            NASA plans to address the issue by flying Artemis II with a “modified trajectory.” That will include reducing the amount of time that Orion spends “skipping” across the atmospshere, officials said.\n    \n\n            The announcement marks only the latest in a string of delays for the space agency’s cornerstone Artemis Program.\n    \n\n            NASA has sporadically announced various timeline shifts as the agency works to gear up for Artemis II, a mission that will send astronauts into deep space. So far, the agency has only launched one uncrewed test flight of the rocket slated to fly astronauts to the moon: The Space Launch System. That test flight, called Artemis I, took flight in 2022.\n    \n\n            The delays are moving the target landing date for Artemis III, the mission that will carry astronauts to the lunar surface, closer to the timeframe NASA had targeted before President-elect Donald Trump’s first term.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDCIM\\100GOPRO\\GOPR1347.\n\nCourtesy NASA\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nMannequins flew around the moon on a path astronauts could soon take. Scientists just revealed how they fared\n\n\n\n\n            Prior to Trump taking office, NASA had targeted 2028 for the first moon landing. But in 2019, then-Vice President Mike Pence made the stunning declaration that the administration would direct NASA to drastically accelerate that timeline, aiming to conduct a crewed moon landing by 2024.\n    \n\n            Pence in part announced the decision to try to accelerate a US moon landing as part of a space race against China. Officials on Capitol Hill have routinely raised alarm bells about the possibility of losing US dominance in space.\n    \n\n            During a press event in April this year, officials from China announced they planned to put astronauts on the moon by 2030.\n    \n\n            On Thursday, Nelson also highlighted NASA’s intention to land astronauts on the moon’s south pole, which is believed to be home to valuable stores of water ice that could be converted into rocket fuel or even drinking water.\n    \n\n            “It is vital for us to land on the south pole, so that we do not cede portions of that lunar south pole to the Chinese,” Nelson said.\n    \n\n            The delay announcement comes as NASA is headed for another period of transition, with the next Trump administration moving in. On Wednesday, Trump revealed his intention to nominate Jared Isaacman, a billionaire tech entrepreneur with deep ties to Elon Musk and SpaceX, as NASA administrator.\n    \n\n            NASA could face additional schedule change directives under the incoming leadership. Isaacman has also publicly expressed his distaste for certain elements of NASA’s current Artemis program, including how the space agency handed out multiple contracts for the development of a lunar lander that will ferry astronauts from Orion down to the lunar surface.",

So far, the agency has only launched one uncrewed test flight of the rocket slated to fly astronauts to the moon: The Space Launch System. That test flight, called Artemis I, took flight in 2022.\n    \n\n            The delays are moving the target landing date for Artemis III, the mission that will carry astronauts to the lunar surface, closer to the timeframe NASA had targeted before President-elect Donald Trump’s first term.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDCIM\\100GOPRO\\GOPR1347.\n\nCourtesy NASA\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nMannequins flew around the moon on a path astronauts could soon take. Scientists just revealed how they fared\n\n\n\n\n            Prior to Trump taking office, NASA had targeted 2028 for the first moon landing. But in 2019, then-Vice President Mike Pence made the stunning declaration that the administration would direct NASA to drastically accelerate that timeline, aiming to conduct a crewed moon landing by 2024.\n    \n\n            Pence in part announced the decision to try to accelerate a US moon landing as part of a space race against China. Officials on Capitol Hill have routinely raised alarm bells about the possibility of losing US dominance in space.\n    \n\n            During a press event in April this year, officials from China announced they planned to put astronauts on the moon by 2030.\n    \n\n            On Thursday, Nelson also highlighted NASA’s intention to land astronauts on the moon’s south pole, which is believed to be home to valuable stores of water ice that could be converted into rocket fuel or even drinking water.\n    \n\n            “It is vital for us to land on the south pole, so that we do not cede portions of that lunar south pole to the Chinese,” Nelson said.\n    \n\n            The delay announcement comes as NASA is headed for another period of transition, with the next Trump administration moving in. On Wednesday, Trump revealed his intention to nominate Jared Isaacman, a billionaire tech entrepreneur with deep ties to Elon Musk and SpaceX, as NASA administrator.\n    \n\n            NASA could face additional schedule change directives under the incoming leadership. Isaacman has also publicly expressed his distaste for certain elements of NASA’s current Artemis program, including how the space agency handed out multiple contracts for the development of a lunar lander that will ferry astronauts from Orion down to the lunar surface.",

They are not the earliest eyed needles in the archaeological record, but for the first time scientists have been able to identify what the needles were made of by analyzing protein information contained in the bone collagen. The results were not what they expected.\n    \n\n            “We had assumed they would be made out of bison or mammoth bone, which comprise most of the animal bones found at La Prele and other sites of its age in the High Plains and Rocky Mountains of North America,” said Wyoming state archaeologist Spencer Pelton, lead author of a new study on the needles published November 27 in the scientific journal PLOS ONE.\n    \n\n            Instead, the needles were created from the bones of red foxes, bobcats, mountain lions, lynx, the now-extinct American cheetah, and hares or rabbits, the study found.\n    \n\n            “It was extremely surprising that these needles were made out of small carnivores,” Pelton said.\n    \n\n            The scientists reached their conclusions by extracting collagen from the artifacts and analyzing its chemical composition, specifically short chains of amino acids known as peptides, and then comparing those results with peptide data from animals known to have existed during that period in North America. It’s a technique known as zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry, or ZooMS.\n    \n\n            The La Prele Mammoth site was discovered in 1986, and archaeologists believe a group of prehistoric people either killed or scavenged a young mammoth there, setting up a temporary camp to process its carcass. Given the age of the site and some distinctive artifacts, the people who camped out at La Prele were likely from the Clovis culture, one of North America’s oldest known human populations.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe eyed needle above, made from the bone of a red fox, was found at the La Prele archaeological site in Wyoming’s Converse County.\n\nTodd Surovell\n\n\n\n        Needle in a haystack\n\n\n            Finding the tiny needles required a thorough and precise excavation, Pelton said. The team identified concentrations of buried artifacts by digging multiple test pits 1 square meter (10.8 square feet) in size until they identified relatively dense concentrations of artifacts. Larger excavations of 25 to 30 square meters (270 to 323 square feet), revealed the floors of dozens of temporary dwellings.\n    \n\n            However, the team found the needles only when they used 1/16th-inch (1.6-millimeter) fine screen mesh to sift the excavated sediment.\n    \n\n            “Relatively few archaeological sites are excavated with this level of precision, so it’s possible that bone needles have been missed during previous excavations at other sites,” Pelton said.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCo-principal investigator Todd Surovell water screens sediment from La Prele in 2016. Archaeologists use water screening to find tiny artifacts like bone needles.\n\nDanny Walker\n\n\n\n            Prehistoric people occupied the site toward the end of the last ice age, and temperatures would have been 5 to 7 degrees Celsius colder than they are today, Pelton said.\n    \n\n            To survive such low temperatures, humans likely created tailored garments with closely stitched seams to protect against the elements. However, clothing is perishable and all but invisible in the archaeological record for this period, save for the needles that produced the garments.\n    \n\n            “This sort of climate would have required pretty robust, tailored parkas of the sort produced by the historic Inuit,” Pelton said. “It would have likely incorporated fur fringes around the sleeves and hood, which is why we think people were trapping animals like foxes, cats and hares in the first place.”\n    \n\n            Before the invention of needles, humans likely wore looser, draped clothing made using pointed tools called awls, which created more widely spaced and coarsely perforated seams, the study noted. Needles also made it possible to decorate clothes, and the oldest bead, made from hare bone, found in the Americas was previously discovered at the same site.\n    \n\n            For thread, early Americans likely used the sinew from the connective tissues of large mammals, Pelton said. \n    \n\n        Evidence of animal trapping\n\n\n            Foxes and wild cats are difficult to kill using traditional hunting tools such as spears, so Pelton suspects Stone Age hunters caught the small carnivores with traps, although direct evidence of animal trapping hasn’t been found at sites of this age in North America.\n    \n\n            It makes sense that early humans would use the small, thin paw bones of dogs, cats and hares to make needles, said Ian Gilligan, an honorary associate in the discipline of archaeology at the University of Sydney in Australia. He wasn’t involved in the research but authored a recent study on the development of eyed needles.\n    \n\n            “These distal limb and paw bones are generally the right size and shape and need relatively little work to turn them into needles, mainly sharpening one end and drilling a hole in the opposite end,” he explained.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReconstructions and Micro-CT scans reveal differences among the bones of various animal specimens.\n\nPelton et al., 2024\n\n\n\n            “Other bones from these animals are either thicker or not as straight, and comparable bones from larger animals like bison would require more work to turn into needles,” he added. “For hunter-gatherers, crafting needles to sew tailored clothes is a time-consuming task, so any strategy that makes the manufacture of needles more efficient will have survival advantages.”\n    \n\n            Once equipped with warm, close-fitting garments, humans had the capacity to expand their range to places from which they were previously excluded due to the threat of hypothermia or death from exposure, according to the study, making eyed needles an extremely important prehistoric innovation.\n    \n\n            It is “no coincidence” that needles are found at the oldest sites in North America — the continent was likely unoccupied until humans had the ability to make tailored clothes, Gilligan noted.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGilligan et al\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nA prehistoric innovation marked a major shift in how humans dress, scientists say\n\n\n\n\n            “Regardless of how good they were as hunter-gatherers, humans could never push into regions like northern Siberia without sophisticated clothes,” Gilligan said.\n    \n\n            “Without needles, humans could not walk across the land bridge between Siberia and North America, a dry corridor that was exposed by low sea levels as the climate became colder toward the end of the last ice age,” he added.\n    \n\n            Gilligan said the needles discovered at the Wyoming site are smaller and more delicate but otherwise similar to the world’s oldest needles, used in Siberia 40,000 years ago and in northern China 35,000 to 30,000 years ago.\n    \n\n            “Compared to loose garments like capes and cloaks, tailored clothes offer better protection from wind chill … Needles would also be useful for sewing the inner layers in multilayered garment assemblages, which provide added thermal insulation — the beginning of underwear,” he said.\n    \n\n            The research adds to a growing body of research suggesting that hunting strategies among hunter-gatherers were “not always about getting food.”\n    \n\n            “Some of the major technological innovations and trends in human prehistory may relate to clothes rather than food,” Gilligan said, “and the invention of needles is perhaps just one example.”",

The farthest spacecraft from Earth, Voyager 1 is currently exploring uncharted territory about 15.4 billion miles (24.9 billion kilometers) away.\n    \n\n            The probe autonomously made the transmitter swap when its computer determined that Voyager I had too little power after the mission team sent a command to turn on one of its heaters.\n    \n\n            The unexpected change prevented engineers from being able to receive information about Voyager 1’s status, as well as the scientific data collected by the spacecraft’s instruments, for nearly a month.\n    \n\n            After some clever problem-solving, the team was able to switch Voyager 1 back to its X-band radio transmitter and receive its daily stream of data again starting in mid-November.\n    \n\n            “The probes were never really designed to be operated like this and the team is learning new things day by day,” said Kareem Badaruddin, Voyager mission manager at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, in an email. “Thankfully they were able to recover from this issue and learned some things.”\n    \n\n            But it’s just one of many challenges the mission team has had to face in recent years as Voyager 1, and its twin probe, Voyager 2, continue to defy the odds and explore space more than 47 years after they lifted off.\n    \n\n        Decreasing power, creative solutions\n\n\n            The probes, which launched weeks apart in 1977, have long outlasted their original missions, designed to fly by the largest planets in our solar system over the course of four years.\n    \n\n            Now, they’re in interstellar space and the only spacecraft to operate beyond the heliosphere, the sun’s bubble of magnetic fields and particles that extends well beyond the orbit of Pluto.\n    \n\n            Both spacecraft are powered by the heat from decaying plutonium that is converted into electricity. Each year, the probes lose about 4 watts of power, according to NASA. That’s equivalent to a small, energy-efficient light bulb.\n    \n\n            “We’ve known that power is running out (on board) both Voyagers for some time,” Badaruddin said. “This year it forced the mission to turn off a science instrument on Voyager 2. But these probes have lasted so much longer than anyone anticipated they would, and it’s amazing that we’re squeezing every last bit of power (and science!) out of them.”\n    \n\n            The mission team began turning off any systems that weren’t crucial for flying the probes about five years ago. Some of those systems included heaters that were designed to keep the science instruments operating at the correct temperature.\n    \n\n            But to their surprise, all the instruments kept working, even at temperatures lower than those at which they had been tested decades before.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The Progress 90 cargo craft carrying nearly three tons of food, fuel, and supplies approaches the International Space Station for a docking to the Poisk module.

Heat can help reverse the radiation damage, which degrades the performance of the spacecraft’s components, he said.\n    \n\n            But the command sent to the heater on October 16 triggered the spacecraft’s autonomous fault protection system. If the spacecraft draws more power than it should, the fault protection system automatically shuts off systems that aren’t essential to conserve energy. The team discovered the latest issue when it couldn’t detect a response signal from the spacecraft on October 18.\n    \n\n            Given that the Voyager probes have already shut off all of their nonessential systems except for science instruments, the fault protection system shut off the X-band transmitter and switched to the S-band transmitter because the latter uses less power.\n    \n\n            Voyager 1 has been using the X-band transmitter for decades, but the S-band hadn’t been employed since 1981 because its signal is much fainter than the X-band’s. The team had to seek out the faint S-band signal before they could restore reliable communication with the spacecraft.\n    \n\n            The mission team successfully commanded Voyager 1 to revert to the X-band transmitter on November 7 and began collecting science data the week of November 18, and they are actively resetting the system used to synchronize Voyager’s three computers. This is one of the last tasks to make sure Voyager is back to how it was before the transmitter issue.\n    \n\n            This transmitter switch is just one of several innovative hacks NASA has used to overcome communication challenges with the long-lived mission this year, including firing up old thrusters to keep Voyager 1’s antenna pointed at Earth and coming up with a solution for a computer glitch that silenced the probe’s stream of science data to Earth for months.\n    \n\n        Keeping the Voyager probes online\n\n\n            The Voyager team has computer models to help them predict how much power the spacecraft’s heaters and instruments are expected to use. But the fact that turning on one heater triggered the fault protection system is a signal to the team that the probe’s future is more uncertain than they realized.\n    \n\n            “This implies that the virtual model that the team uses to calculate how much power is available (and thus how many systems/instruments can be operated) has uncertainties and/or is incomplete at the level that the mission is currently working at, which often involves a margin of less than a watt,” Badaruddin said. “There used to be a small reservoir of power available for situations like this, but earlier this year the team opted to use that reservoir to keep science instruments going longer.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an image of the planet Uranus taken by the spacecraft Voyager 2 in 1986. The Voyager project is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNASA/JPL-Caltech\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nNew Uranus research suggests what’s known about the planet could be wrong\n\n\n\n\n            The Voyager probes started out with 10 science instruments each. Certain instruments were shut off on Voyager 1 in 1990 to conserve energy because those tools were no longer needed after the spacecraft completed its flybys of Jupiter and Saturn.\n    \n\n            Now, just four instruments operate on each spacecraft, and they are used to study charged gas called plasma, magnetic fields and particles in interstellar space, and the Voyager probes are the only spacecraft studying this uncharted territory.\n    \n\n            Voyager 1 and its twin send back science data continuously through the Deep Space Network, a system of radio antennae on Earth, with about six to eight hours of the probes’ detections returning each day. Data isn’t stored on board, so anything that was sent home by Voyager 1 during the transmitter issue was lost.\n    \n\n            “However, the science that Voyager is doing now is really about the big picture and long-term observations, so the team is not too concerned with this drop-out,” Badaruddin said. “The bigger issue is how long can we keep the science instruments going with the current power available.”",

Webb’s view makes the “crown” of the sombrero invisible, changing the appearance of the galaxy to resemble a bull’s-eye. Meanwhile, distant galaxies glimmer in the background of the image.\n    \n\n            The galaxy — also known as Messier 104, or M104 — is about 30 million light-years from Earth in the Virgo constellation. French astronomer and comet hunter Pierre Méchain discovered it in 1781. Méchain named the galactic find for his colleague Charles Messier, who famously cataloged star clusters and nebulae.\n    \n\n            Webb’s sensitive instruments can detect celestial objects through varying wavelengths of infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye, to reveal previously unseen details of the universe.\n    \n\n            The fine details of Messier 104 detected by MIRI also showcase the galaxy’s outer ring, revealing how dust — a crucial ingredient for celestial objects such as stars and planets — is structured and distributed throughout the galaxy.\n    \n\n            Previously, when NASA’s now-retired Spitzer Space Telescope observed the Sombrero galaxy, the outer ring appeared smooth, but Webb’s new imagery reveals the complex, clumpy nature of the dusty ring, which could suggest the presence of a stellar nursery.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHubble: Messier 104, The Sombrero Galaxy Looking like a broad-brimmed Mexican hat, the “Sombrero” galaxy, M104, is a spiral galaxy seen nearly edge-on.\n\nNASA and The Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/AURA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASA’s James Webb Space Telescope recently imaged the Sombrero galaxy with its MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument), resolving the clumpy nature of the dust along the galaxy’s outer ring. This image includes filters representing 7.7-micron light as blue, 11.3-micron light as green, and 12.8-micron light as red.\n\nNASA/ESA/CSA/STScI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sombrero Galaxy is imaged in visible light by the Hubble Space Telescope, left, and in mid-infrared light by the James Webb Space Telescope’s MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument).\nNASA/ESA/CSA/Hubble Heritage Team/STScI/AURA\n\n\n\n            Webb’s new detections also enabled astronomers to spot carbon-containing molecules, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, in the dust ring, which further suggests that the galaxy’s outer ring may be home to star-forming regions. But the Sombrero galaxy is quiet in terms of star formation compared with other galaxies such as Messier 82. Ten times as many stars are born in the latter galaxy than the estimated 100 billion stars that exist in the Milky Way.\n    \n\n            Scientists estimate that the rings of the Sombrero galaxy produce less than one solar mass of stars each year, with one solar mass equaling the mass of our sun. In contrast, the Milky Way is responsible for creating about two solar masses a year, according to NASA.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis composite image of nebula NGC 1333 captures minute detail of young stars and brown dwarfs. These details were previously obscured in Hubble Telescope's images of the same nebula.\n\nESA/Webb/NASA/CSA\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nWebb telescope spots six rogue worlds within a glowing cosmic cloud\n\n\n\n\n            The supermassive black hole at the center of the Sombrero galaxy is also less active than those at the center of other galaxies, slowly consuming material from Messier 104 and releasing a bright but small jet of radiation.\n    \n\n            But the galaxy is full of 2,000 globular clusters, or groups of hundreds of thousands of old stars gravitationally held together, providing the perfect place for astronomers to conduct comparison studies of stars that are the same age but differ in mass and other aspects.\n    \n\n            The Webb telescope, launched in December 2021, will begin its fourth year of observing the universe in July. Scientists across the globe have applied for observation time with the telescope to search for exoplanets and their atmospheres, stars and distant galaxies.",

The young sharks are typically 3 to 7 meters (10 to 23 feet) in length, making them more vulnerable to predators. While an orca versus whale shark matchup may seem like an epic battle, the orcas make easy work of the gentle giants.\n    \n\n            “The whale shark has the smallest brain compared to body mass. The brain is the size of an egg,” said Francesca Pancaldi, first author of the study and a researcher at Centro Interdisciplinario de Ciencias Marinas in Mexico.\n    \n\n            “It’s a big, big fish that is very slow compared with other sharks. It has tiny, tiny teeth that it doesn’t use as a defense mechanism,” Pancaldi added. “The only defense it has is flailing or diving down. It can dive to 2,000 meters or more.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe orcas surface to breathe before delivering a rapid, final blow.\n\nKelsey Williamson\n\n\n\n            The hunts described in the study, published Friday in the journal “Frontiers in Marine Science,” occurred between 2018 and 2024 and were captured in images and videos taken by scientists and members of the public.\n    \n\n            The authors were able to identify the orcas involved by looking at distinctive features such as dorsal fins or scars on the animals’ bodies. In three of four hunting events, a male orca — nicknamed Moctezuma after the Aztec emperor — that is around 8 meters (26 feet) long was present.\n    \n\n            A female orca previously observed in the presence of Moctezuma participated in one event also, suggesting they could be related or members of the same pod, said senior study author Erick Higuera Rivas, a marine biologist at Conexiones Terramar, a nonprofit organization.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn orca hits the belly of a whale shark head-on.\n\nKelsey Williamson\n\n\n\n        Orca vs. whale shark\n\n\n            The researchers’ analysis revealed exactly how the killer whales, often hunting as a group, subdue the whale shark.\n    \n\n            First, the orcas use their bodies to hit a whale shark at high speed. Then, they flip the whale shark so it’s floating belly up and unable to dive down to escape. The orcas then bite the abdomen of their prey, allowing its blood to flow out before consuming its internal organs.\n    \n\n            “You can clearly see how all the members of the orca pod are trying to bring down the whale shark,” Higuera Rivas said.\n    \n\n            “While one orca was bumping him on the ventral (belly) side, the other one was bumping him on the head. Then eventually the whale shark is taken into an upside-down position,” he added.\n    \n\n            This maneuver puts the whale shark in a state seen in other animals called “tonic immobility” — essentially temporary paralysis resulting from extreme fear.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrcas in the vicinity of a 6-meter-long juvenile whale shark, which is weakly swimming at the surface.\nGuillermo Aceves Salazar\n\n\n\n\n            The study authors believe the orcas are plundering the whale shark’s large and nutrient-rich liver, which makes up a significant amount of the shark’s body weight, but the researchers didn’t observe the orcas consuming the organ.\n    \n\n            “As apex predators, killer whales have been known to hunt sharks for their fatty livers,” said Sarah Teman, a doctoral student in the University of Washington’s School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences.\n    \n\n            “However, what makes this discovery exciting is that it’s the first time we’ve seen this behavior clearly documented with whale sharks, which are the largest sharks on the planet,” Teman, who was not involved in the study, added in an email. “It’s a pretty amazing find!”\n    \n\n            Found worldwide, orcas are the ocean’s apex predators. They prey on a wide variety of creatures: fish, marine mammals like seals and dolphins, sea turtles, and cephalopods such as squid.\n    \n\n            While there is just one species of orca there are multiple ecotypes, or groups that share similarities in their appearance and behavior.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral of the killer whales were observed with whale shark carrion in their mouths during an attack on May 26.\n\nKelsey Williamson\n\n\n\n            It’s possible the Gulf of California orcas may form a new ecotype that specifically targets elasmobranchs — sharks and rays — Pancaldi and Higuera Rivas said, although more research is needed to prove the case. Moctezuma, who was first spotted in 1992, has been seen hunting other elasmobranch species such as the Munk’s pygmy devil ray, which is 1 meter (3.2 feet) wide, bull sharks and stingrays.\n    \n\n            “More research is needed to understand where this specialized pod fits into our knowledge of ecotypes,” Teman said.\n    \n\n            In South Africa, orcas have developed techniques to kill great white sharks, one of the ocean’s most fearsome predators. The behavior has driven the sharks away from some parts of the coast around Cape Town in what some experts think is a worrying ecological shift.\n    \n\n            However, Pancaldi said that the orcas’ appetite for whale sharks had not resulted in any significant consequences for the population of whale sharks that gather in the Gulf of California or the wider ecosystem.",

The new law states that Mexico’s Immigration Institute will issue a “collective visa to every person on the ship’s passenger list.”\n    \n\n            And all of this is setting off alarm bells among some tourism groups.\n    \n\n            When added to a $5 per passenger fee imposed by local states, it would make Mexican destinations among the most expensive in the world, according to the Mexican Association of Naval Agents (AMANAC).\n    \n\nIn a statement, the association urged the government to reconsider its implementation.  It warns the Mexican cruise industry would be less competitive with other Caribbean destinations that would be less expensive to visit. Currently, cruise ship passengers are exempt from Mexico’s immigration fees as they’re considered to be “in transit.”\n    \n\n        A potentially big impact\n\n\n            The fee, approved by both chambers of the Mexican Congress, earmarks two thirds of the levy to fund the Mexican army.\n    \n\n            The new charge is scheduled to go into effect on January 1, leaving little time for tourists to adjust to the new expense.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Disney Treasure, Disney Cruise Line’s newest ship, will embark on its maiden voyage Dec. 21, 2024, followed by an inaugural season of seven-night itineraries to the Eastern and Western Caribbean from Port Canaveral, Florida. Adventure serves as the architectural and thematic foundation of the ship, in honor of Walt Disney’s legendary passion for travel and exploration.

She also said that conversations are ongoing among the agencies affected by the fee.\n    \n\n        Further reaction to the fee\n\n\n            Michele Paige, CEO of the Florida-Caribbean Cruise Association, a trade group representing vessels operating in the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean, says that most of the cruises booked for 2025 are already paid for and the companies might be reluctant to take their passengers to places that impose unexpected fees.\n    \n\n            “We appreciate President Sheinbaum’s assurance during her Wednesday [December 4] news conference that the change will happen slowly and that she’s instructed federal officials to work with our industry, but we haven’t heard from anyone yet,” said Paige in a news release sent to CNN Travel on Thursday.\n    \n\n            Sergio Gonzales Rubiera is not yet alarmed over the new fee. He’s the president of The Travel Agents Association in Cozumel, Mexico’s main cruise destination and one of the most visited ports in the world.\n    \n\n            He says that some cruise lines might skip Mexican ports in protest, but he thinks most will include the fee in the price of future trips. What he laments is that the federal government will keep most of the money instead of helping local communities.\n    \n\n            Former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador expanded the role of the Mexican armed forces that now oversee the construction of many infrastructure projects such as El Tren Maya, a series of new train routes connecting some of southeastern Mexico’s tourist destinations.",

Madrid is at No.2, Rome and Milan are at No.4 and No.5, Amsterdam is at No.7 and Barcelona is at No.10.\n    \n\n            London, which was at No.10 last year and recently topped an alternative World’s Best Cities index, only makes it to No.13 on the list, between Seoul at No.12 and Dubai at No.14.\n    \n\n            While London ranks just after Paris for the best tourism infrastructure, it failed to break Euromonitor international’s top 10 for tourism policy, health and safety or sustainability.\n    \n\n        Bangkok top city for international arrivals\n\n\n            Asia-Pacific performed well, with Tokyo at No.3, Sydney at No.8 and Singapore at No.9. The yen hit record lows against major currencies in 2024, making it an attractive proposition globally for both business and leisure travel. Close to 13 million international Tokyo trips were recorded in 2024, says Euromonitor International, notably higher than pre-pandemic levels.\n    \n\n            New York, at No.6, is the only American city in the top 10. Los Angeles, at No.18, is the next highest. New York takes the top spot in the category for tourism performance, with high demand both internationally and domestically.\n    \n\n            Bangkok is the top city for tourism policy and attractiveness and also was the No.1 city worldwide in 2024 for international arrivals. Euromonitor International reports a whopping 32.4 million international trips there in 2024, nearly 10 million more than last year’s No.1, Istanbul, which in 2024 has recorded 23 million.\n    \n\n        The overtourism problem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmsterdam is one of several European cities introducing measures to counter overtourism.\n\nKoen Smilde/Discover Amsterdam\n\n\n\n            London is No.3 for international arrivals, with 21.7 million trips and 7% growth. Hong Kong is at No.4, with 20.5 international arrivals and 19% growth, and the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia was at No.5, with 19.3 million visitors and 20% growth.\n    \n\n            Euromonitor International notes several trends for 2024. Numerous destinations have simplified their visa processes, implementing electronic travel authorizations and expanding short-term visa-free entry.\n    \n\n            On the other hand, overtourism has become a big global headache too. To manage the overflow of visitors in the busiest tourist destinations, cities are introducing measures such as tourism-related taxes and restricted visiting hours.\n    \n\n            There’s also a major crackdown on short-term rentals.

Neal's Yard Dairy has been the victim of a theft resulting in the loss of over 22 tonnes of clothbound Cheddar.The theft involved a fraudulent buyer posing as a legitimate wholesale distributor for a major French retailer. Over 950 wheels of Hafod, Westcombe, and Pitchfork Cheddar were delivered before the fraud was discovered. Despite the significant financial blow, we have honoured our commitment to our small-scale suppliers and paid all three artisan cheesemakers in full.We are currently working with law enforcement authorities to identify the perpetrators of this fraud. In the meantime, we would like to put out a call to everyone within our esteemed community of cheesemongers around the world. If anyone is offered or receives cheeses they believe may have been associated with this theft, particularly clothbound Cheddars in a 10kg or 24kg format with the tags detached, please contact info@nealsyarddairy.co.uk so we can support the police in their investigation.\n\nNeal's Yard Dairy/Instagram\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nFraudsters scam famed London cheese company out of $390,000 of cheddar\n\n\n\n\n            The chef also wrote a caption alongside the video.\n    \n\n            “The pies are all in boxes with my name on so not very easy to sell.

Several high-profile architects, including Norman Foster and Tadao Ando, were commissioned to create structures in Mareterra.

The city state’s conference center, the Grimaldi Forum, was also expanded as part of the project.\n    \n\n            Land is notoriously scarce in Monaco, which has a long history of building into the sea. Reclaimed land now accounts for more than a quarter of the principality’s territory.

Italian architect Renzo Piano, best known for co-designing the Centre Pompidou, lent his name to the residential development building his firm designed on the site, Le Renzo.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new development features more than 100 new luxury apartments in one of the world's most densely populated places.\n\nMareterra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral high-profile architects were commissioned to create structures on the site.\n\nMareterra\n\n\n\n            While housing prices have not been disclosed, Knight Frank estimates that properties in the district will fetch around 100,000 euros per square meter (or more than $9,750 per square foot, almost twice Monaco’s average).\n    \n\n            The development was privately funded, though Monaco’s government will benefit from a 20% tax on all property sales. The city state’s conference center, the Grimaldi Forum, was also expanded as part of the project.\n    \n\n            Land is notoriously scarce in Monaco, which has a long history of building into the sea. Reclaimed land now accounts for more than a quarter of the principality’s territory. The most significant reclamation projects took place in the 1960s and 1970s, when the Larvotto and Fontvieille districts were expanded into the Mediterranean.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn aerial view of Mareterra, which is built on almost 15 acres of reclaimed land.\n\nMareterra\n\n\n\n            Earlier land reclamation efforts attracted the ire of environmentalists worried about the impact on Monaco’s marine life, which today includes 60 species of coral.\n    \n\n            A more recent proposal was abandoned in 2009 due, in part, to ecological concerns raised by Prince Albert II, who is renowned for his work protecting ocean biodiversity.\n    \n\n            Land reclamation in Monaco is now tightly regulated, and Mareterra’s developers said they took various steps to “minimize the impact on the natural ecosystem as much as possible.” The project’s website says planners consulted marine experts and created new habitats for fish, including artificial seagrass beds.\n    \n\n            Developers also claim that 80% of heating and cooling in the district will run on renewable energy, including the power generated by more than 1.2 acres of solar panels.",

        "content": "CNN\n         — \n    \n\n\nNotre Dame, the treasured Gothic gem in Paris that went up in flames in 2019, will officially reopen Saturday.\n    \n\n            Immediately after the fire, French President Emmanuel Macron made the ambitious pledge to restore the church within five years.\n    \n\n            On Friday, he praised hundreds of artisans, carpenters and other specialists for helping him “keep this promise” during his final site visit.\n    \n\n            “You did it. And it’s an immense source of pride for the entire nation. I’m infinitely grateful to you, France is infinitely grateful to you,” Macron said.\n    \n\n            Here’s everything you need to know about the days ahead.\n    \n\n        What’s happened so far?\n\n\n            On April 15, 2019, Notre Dame was engulfed in flames. The cause of the blaze remains a mystery. Investigators say it was likely an accident – perhaps a burning cigarette or an electrical malfunction.\n    \n\n            France – and much of the world – despaired as the 860-year-old cathedral’s roof caved in, strewing the stone floor below with soot. Macron called it a “terrible tragedy,” and pledged to rebuild the landmark church “because it is what our history deserves.”\n    \n\n            Some of the country’s richest businessmen pledged hundreds of millions of euros towards the restoration.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmoke and flames rise from the burning Notre Dame cathedral on April 15, 2019.\n\nPhilippe Lopez/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            After more than 2,000 days’ work – involving 2,000 people, 2,000 oak trees and 2,000 features restored or rebuilt – the world got its first glimpse of “Our Lady of Paris” last week, as the French president toured the restored landmark with his wife, Brigitte, and a cluster of clergymen.\n    \n\n            The official reopening begins with a ceremony on Saturday, followed by eight days of special masses and prayers.\n    \n\n        Who’s been invited?\n\n\n            The guest list will be long and illustrious, but the most notable attendee will be Donald Trump. The US president-elect announced this week he will travel to Paris – his first overseas trip since last month’s election – for what will be “a very special day for all.”\n    \n\n            The ceremony is expected to draw some 50 heads of state and government.\n    \n\n            One noteworthy absentee, however, will be Pope Francis. The pontiff will travel to the French Mediterranean island of Corsica on December 15, just days after the reopening, but is skipping a visit to the capital. A leading French archbishop said the “star” of the ceremony ought to be Notre Dame itself, and that the pope did not want to distract from the occasion.\n    \n\n            Some 170 bishops from France and around the world will also be involved in the ceremony, along with one priest from each of the 106 parishes in the Paris diocese.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cathedral's new interior was revealed on November 29.\n\nChristophe Petit Tesson/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n\n        What’s happening on Saturday?\n\n\n            Macron will give a speech in front of the cathedral at around 6 p.m. (12 p.m. ET). The Archbishop of Paris Laurent Ulrich will then strike the closed cathedral doors with his crozier, an ornate staff.\n    \n\n            Once the doors open, the cathedral “responds” to the knock by singing Psalm 121 – which begins “I will lift mine eyes unto the hills” – three times. After this, the doors will open.\n    \n\n            The ceremony then proceeds in three parts. First, the “awakening” of the great organ – the largest in France, comprising 8,000 pipes and 115 stops. Second, the “chanting of the office” – a series of psalms and prayers, including the Lord’s Prayer. Then, the archbishop will give a final blessing and the choir will sing Te Deum, a Latin hymn.\n    \n\n            The service will be followed by a broadcast by France TV, chronicling the cathedral’s rebuilding.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nave of Notre Dame cathedral.

        "content": "CNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            American model Alex Consani has become the first transgender woman to win Model of the Year, following a string of high-profile runway appearances for labels like Chanel, Stella McCartney and Victoria’s Secret.\n    \n\n            The in-demand 21-year-old, who is known for her distinctive bleached hair and eyebrows, claimed the title at the 2024 Fashion Awards in London on Monday evening.\n    \n\n            In her acceptance speech, Consani told a star-studded audience at the Royal Albert Hall that her victory marked a “big step in the right direction.”\n    \n\n            “Now, more than ever, it’s an important conversation that should be had about how to truly support and uplift one another within this industry, especially those who have been made to feel insignificant,” she added, to cheers from the crowd, after collecting her trophy from model and body activist Ashley Graham and “Baby Reindeer” star Nava Mau.\n    \n\n            “Because change is more than possible — it’s needed.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsani takes the stage at the Royal Albert Hall in London to accept the award for Model of the Year.\n\nJeff Spicer/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            Having signed with IMG Models (an agency representing supermodels including Claudia Schiffer, Hailey Bieber and the Hadid sisters) in 2019, Consani rose to prominence through TikTok, where she now boasts almost 4 million followers. She made her catwalk debut for Tom Ford in 2021 and later walked for top labels such as Alexander McQueen and Versace.\n    \n\n            In October, Consani and Valentina Sampaio made history by becoming the first trans models to appear on the runway at the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show.\n    \n\n            Wearing a ripped Union Flag dress by Turkish-British designer Dilara Findikoglu, California-born Consani used her acceptance speech to honor the Black transgender women — including fellow models Connie Fleming and Aaron Rose Philip — who “really fought for the space … that allowed me to flourish today.” She also paid tribute to her parents for supporting her modeling aspirations.\n    \n\n\n\nRelated article\nCan a troubled Victoria’s Secret successfully write its next chapter? It’s certainly pulling out all the stops\n\n\n\n\n            Recognizing the “the global impact” of someone who has “dominated the industry” in the last 12 months, the prestigious Model of the Year prize combines the opinion of an industry panel with the result of a public vote, according to award organizers the British Fashion Council. Black trans model Kai-Isaiah Jamal was among the nominees for last year’s award, which was ultimately won by plus-size model Paloma Elsesser.\n    \n\n            Elsewhere at Monday’s ceremony, Jonathan Anderson, creative director of Loewe and founder of JW Anderson, won the coveted Designer of the Year award for the second consecutive year. And Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour presented Tom Ford with the Outstanding Achievement Award.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRihanna and A$AP Rocky, who took home the Cultural Innovator Award, were among the stars in attendance.\n\nSamir Hussein/WireImage/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            Featuring performances from Blondie singer Debbie Harry and Afrobeats star Wizkid, the glitzy ceremony saw major fashion industry figures rub shoulders with the stars of entertainment, music and sport, including Rita Ora and Venus Williams. Also in attendance (and wearing an eye-catching blue furry hat) was Rihanna, whose partner A$AP Rocky took home the Cultural Innovator Award.\n    \n\n            Categories for the best British menswear and womenswear designers were meanwhile awarded to Grace Wales Bonner and Simone Rocha, respectively. Rocha’s acceptance speech was among several political moments, as she took the stage with a call to “free Palestine.”\n    \n\n            Earlier in the evening, an animal rights demonstrator stormed the red carpet to protest the fashion industry’s use of feathers — just days after London Fashion Week’s announced that it will become the first of the “big four” fashion weeks to ban exotic animal skins on its runways.",

        "content": "CNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            A history of lead in gasoline may be behind tens of millions of mental health conditions in the United States, according to new research.\n    \n\n            “We’ve shifted the curve in the population for mental health problems, so that everyone has a greater liability in the mental illness symptoms, and that some people who were already at risk are going to develop diagnosable disorders sooner, more often or more kinds,” said coauthor of the study Dr. Aaron Reuben, assistant professor of clinical neuropsychology at the University of Virginia.\n    \n\n            The study published Wednesday in The Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry estimates that about 151 million mental disorder diagnoses in the US are attributable to lead. The exposure likely would not have happened had lead not been in gasoline, Reuben added.\n    \n\n            Cars ran on gasoline containing lead starting in the 1920s, and the US did not start phasing out the substance until the 1980s, after substantial evidence of harm over the decades, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Leaded gasoline continues to fuel some planes, race cars, and farm and marine equipment.\n    \n\n            “The people who were exposed are not in the history books,” Reuben said. “Millions of Americans are walking around with an unknown, invisible history of lead exposure that has likely influenced for the worse how they think, feel and behave.”\n    \n\n        How lead impacts the body\n\n\n            Scientists have accumulated research over the last century showing that lead is harmful to almost every organ system, Reuben said.\n    \n\n            In a previous study, he and a team used data on childhood blood-lead levels, leaded gas use, and population statistics to estimate childhood lead exposure and found that half of the US population were exposed to adverse levels of lead early in life.\n    \n\n            The number of people impacted might be unexpected to many people, said Dr. Bruce Lanphear, a population health scientist at Simon Fraser University in Canada with expertise in lead poisoning. He was not involved in the research.\n    \n\n            “Given their caveats and limitations, I think they’ve done a thorough job of trying to estimate exposures,” he said.\n    \n\n            One such limitation was that researchers did not measure all possible exposure sources, meaning that the results may actually underestimate the problem, Lanphear added.\n    \n\n            “We have not been able to fully understand how those exposures influenced health and disease across the century,” Reuben added.\n    \n\n            Lead is a potent neurotoxin and can disrupt brain development in many ways that can impact most types of mental health problems, including anxiety, depression and ADHD, he said. But people were also likely impacted in ways that cannot be diagnosed.\n    \n\n            “It also changed personalities. We believe that (lead exposure) makes people a little less conscientious –– so less well organized, less detail-oriented, less likely to be able to pursue their goals in an organized way, and more neurotic,” Reuben added.\n    \n\n        Millions of homes still contain lead\n\n\n            If lead exposure is a widespread problem and the possible health impacts are serious, what can be done?\n    \n\n            The first step Reuben recommends is to educate yourself on the sources of lead exposure.\n    \n\n            “We completely phased lead out of gasoline in ’96, we phased lead out of pipes in ’86, and we took it out of paint in ’78,” he said. “If you’re living in a home that was built before those years, you should be aware that there is likely a lead hazard in your soil or your home.”\n    \n\n            It doesn’t mean it is time to move out of your older home, just that you should check for lead when doing renovations or disturbing the soil, Reuben said.\n    \n\n            “The (Environmental Protection Agency) recently lowered its soil screening level, and it means that possibly one in four households in the US has soil lead that would now be deemed potentially hazardous,” he added.\n    \n\n            You can test for lead exposure ­­–– Reuben requests tests for his kids at the pediatrician, he said.\n    \n\n            For those that have already been exposed, there isn’t a definitive answer on whether you can reduce your levels of lead, but Reuben recommends taking steps to identify the sources and reducing future exposure. You can also limit harm from the lead by doing other things that promote health like exercising, eating a nutritious diet and cutting out alcohol and cigarettes, he said.\n    \n\n            But the most impactful step will be for institutions to invest in research and the elimination of lead from the environment, Lanphear said.\n    \n\n            “We really need regulatory agencies like the FDA to make sure there’s not lead in the baby food,” he said. “Finding ways to deal with the 20 million homes that still contain lead hazards, getting rid of leaded aviation fuel, these are not things that people can do. This is what the government and regulatory agencies need to do.”\n    \n\n            “We’ve got to stop putting this burden on people and families,” Lanphear added.",

While asking for time apart can feel awkward, I’ve learned that it’s essential for maintaining the strong bonds my family shares.\n    \n\n            I’m certainly not alone in this sentiment; many people find themselves needing a balance of social interactions during the holidays. Forty-six percent of Americans say they get less alone time during the holidays, according to a new survey commissioned by The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and College of Medicine, released on Tuesday.\n    \n\n            “We have a lot of input, demands and stress in general that is elevated during the holidays, so it is extra important to be attentive to your need for alone time,” said Sophie Lazarus, a clinical psychologist in the department of psychiatry and behavioral health at Ohio State and one of the survey’s developers and reviewers.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n\n\n\nvideo\n          \n\n\nRelated video\nHow to stop election politics from ruining your holiday dinner\n\n\n\n\n            The survey, conducted in early October with 1,004 respondents ages 18 and older, also revealed that 56% of respondents believe time alone is critical to their mental well-being.\n    \n\n        Assessing what alone time means for you\n\n\n            Alone time can vary greatly from person to person. For some, it’s simply about being physically away from people, while for others, it’s the ability to disconnect when alone, according to Dr. Ramani Durvasula, a licensed clinical psychologist and Emerita Professor of psychology at California State University, Los Angeles.\n    \n\n            To figure out whether alone time energizes or depletes you, Durvasula suggests dedicating a full day or weekend to just yourself and observing how it affects your emotions.\n    \n\n            If you feel rejuvenated after taking time to yourself, prioritize carving out more alone time into your schedule. However, if solitude feels draining, it might be a sign to lean into social connections more frequently.\n    \n\n            To unwind while alone, Lazarus suggests activities including journaling, meditating, exercising and listening to music to help replenish yourself and be more present when reconnecting with others.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLow section of unrecognizable people cutting pie and vegetables standing around dinner table with homemade food on it\n\nSeventyfour/Adobe Stock\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nFamily member say something rude? Here’s what to say back, according to experts\n\n\n\n\n        Navigating holiday alone time\n\n\n            Although time alone is critical for emotional regulation, it can still be challenging to step away when surrounded by loved ones you don’t see frequently.\n    \n\n            “Sometimes people think that they’re being antisocial or unfriendly if they want downtime and they’re worried about hurting people,” Durvasula said.\n    \n\n            But taking time to disconnect at family celebrations can prevent minor frustrations from overshadowing meaningful connections. In fact, 36% of people say they are more irritable because they don’t get enough alone time, the survey found.\n    \n\n            “We often don’t get to turn down the volume on that constant state of social monitoring and social calibration,” Durvasula said.\n    \n\n            However, there are subtle ways to integrate time alone without formal requests, such as taking a walk, running a solo errand or waking up early for a moment of peace before everyone else starts their day. Lazarus also suggests taking a few extra minutes to wash your hands or breathe deeply in your car before heading into an event to reset your mind.\n    \n\n            For those who want to reconnect with family and friends while also unplugging after what might have been an exhausting year, striking a balance can be difficult, said Dr. Fallon Goodman, assistant professor of psychological and brain sciences at George Washington University in DC.\n    \n\n            But she also notes that specific holidays might lend themselves to alone time.  “On New Year’s Eve, for example, people reflect back on wins, challenges, and losses from the prior year and set goals to enter the new year with purpose and resolve,” she said via email.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiencing social isolation or loneliness is associated with a higher risk of death, a new study has found.\n\nNes/E+/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nLack of certain types of social connection linked with higher risk of dying early, study finds\n\n\n\n\n        Personalizing your approach\n\n\n            Everyone has a different social battery, so some loved ones might resist if you ask for time apart. “Be prepared that sometimes people will push back when you set a limit around (availability),” Durvasula said.\n    \n\n            The recommendation for alone time is also not a one-size-fits-all approach. “Instead, it is critical to tailor socializing strategies based on personal preferences and energy needs,” Goodman said.\n    \n\n            Older adults are significantly less likely to agree that alone time is important, according to the survey, and Lazarus emphasizes that for those who are already feeling lonely, connecting with others is usually the right choice.\n    \n\n            “The bigger picture is to be attentive to your mental health and emotional experience to decide what (amount of alone time) would be most helpful,” Lazarus said.",

        "title": "When male puberty hits, parents need to be prepared",
        "content": "Editor’s note: Dr. Jamin Brahmbhatt is a urologist and robotic surgeon with Orlando Health and an assistant professor at the University of Central Florida’s College of Medicine.\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            As a urologist, I’ve spent my career talking to thousands of men about their health — even those who rarely go to any other doctor appointments. But one of the most important conversations should happen long before they become adults or see me.\n    \n\n            Puberty is a huge transition for boys — I know since I’ve been through it myself. It’s an intense, confusing roller coaster of emotions and physical changes. Those growth spurts, voices cracking and new body hair where there wasn’t any before can sometimes be a lot for tween or teen boys to handle. And for many, no one has prepared them for what’s coming.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCleveland's High School's Healthy Masculinity Club\n\nBrian Fain\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nWhy these high school boys care about ‘healthy masculinity’\n\n\n\n\n            Because so many parents are too embarrassed to talk about all those changes, too many boys get their information from the wrong places: friends, social media, free porn sites and internet-based adult films all painting an unrealistic picture of what’s normal for boys and men.\n    \n\n            So, how do we fill in those gaps and make sure boys get the information they need to feel confident about themselves and their health? It starts with parents and mentors having honest conversations about the changes boys go through and making sure they know it’s OK to ask questions (to us, not a search bar on social media).\n    \n\n        The midnight surprise\n\n\n            When it comes to puberty, there are some things you just can’t prepare for — like that first erection. It can catch boys completely off guard. And while it might feel awkward or embarrassing, the reality is that it’s a normal, natural part of puberty. Erections can happen for no reason at all, and they can show up at the most unexpected times and places.\n    \n\n            Instead of leaving boys to wonder if something is wrong, we need to normalize these experiences. Let them know that it’s just one of many surprises that puberty will shine their way. I know it doesn’t help convince boys it’s normal or anything to be embarrassed about. But they do need to be told that what they see is simply biology doing its thing. This reassurance is crucial for their self-confidence, especially when they’re questioning so much about themselves.\n    \n\n            How much detail to go into is up to a parent or caregiver. But remember, whether you have this conversation or not, boys almost certainly are hearing about it from friends and through social media.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnrecognizable teenager boy with anxiety sitting on the floor of his bedroom with his head resting on his arms\n\ndoble-d/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nBoys and men are experiencing a ‘crisis of connection,’ expert says\n\n\n\n\n        What to do about that extra skin\n\n\n            Whether boys are circumcised or not, it’s important that they understand how to care for themselves properly. In the United States about 58% of male infants are circumcised at birth compared with an estimated 37% to 39% of males globally. But many boys and their parents don’t know that being uncircumcised requires extra attention in the hygiene department.\n    \n\n            For boys who are uncircumcised, it’s important to gently retract the foreskin and clean underneath to prevent infections. They also need to know that extra foreskin, if they have it, is not abnormal. Some boys may feel pressure to get circumcised by their partners or from what they see as “normal” in others. In this case, parents can stress there is no need to get circumcised because of peer pressure.\n    \n\n        Routine body hygiene\n\n\n            As puberty hits, acne and body odor become more common. Getting boys into a simple hygiene routine — such as washing their faces daily, using deodorant and remembering to brush their teeth — goes a long way in helping them deal with those changes and feel more confident about their appearance. These small changes can make a big difference, especially as they navigate social pressures during their growth spurt. Proper hygiene practices can also help boost their self-confidence and set them up for professional success.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfizkes/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nDo you really need deodorant? Experts weigh in\n\n\n\n\n        Monthly self-exams\n\n\n            When I was growing up, I remember having to go through awkward yearly school physicals and hernia exams. But I don’t remember being told that I should check my testicles for lumps every month. That’s a shame because testicular cancer is the most common cancer in young men between 15 and 35. If we teach boys to get into the habit of doing monthly self-exams, we’re giving them an essential tool for saving their lives early on and protecting their long-term health.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn early start to periods could point to poorer health later, experts said.\n\nIsabel Pavia/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nKids are starting menstruation earlier, study shows. Here is what that means for their health\n\n\n\n\n            Self-exams are not about scaring boys — they’re about giving them the knowledge and tools to be proactive. If they notice something unusual, like a lump or swelling, they’ll know to get checked sooner rather than later. This simple habit can save lives and vital organs.\n    \n\n        Building healthy relationships\n\n\n            Puberty is when boys may start new relationships, and it’s vital to teach them about consent and respect early on. According to a study by Planned Parenthood, fewer than a third of all teens receive any formal education about consent before their first sexual experience. That’s a huge communication gap.\n    \n\n            Teaching boys about consent doesn’t have to be complicated. It can start with small lessons — such as asking for permission before using someone’s belongings — and grow into deeper conversations about respect and consent in romantic relationships. And if you haven’t started those conversations, it’s never too late to begin.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModeling can help parents teach boys to be good men.\n\nPeopleImages/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nRaising boys to be good men. Here’s one way to do it\n\n\n\n\n        Controlling their emotions\n\n\n            We often forget that boys are dealing with more than just physical changes during puberty. Their emotions are all over the place thanks to surging hormones. It’s normal to experience mood swings, feel angry or sad for no reason, or struggle with new feelings of attraction. But for boys, there’s often pressure to “tough it out” and keep their emotions bottled up.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMother working from home at kitchen table while son gets her attention\n\nMoMo Productions/Digital Vision/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nBoys on the fringe of society aren’t so different from yours, this boy mom says\n\n\n\n\n            We need to let boys know it’s OK to feel everything they’re going through and that it’s important to talk about it. Encouraging them to find healthy outlets for their emotions — whether that’s talking to a trusted adult or mentor, engaging in sports or writing down their feelings — can make all the difference. Mental health matters just as much as physical health, and boys should know it needs to be a priority.\n    \n\n        Nutrition and exercise\n\n\n            During puberty, boys’ bodies grow rapidly, and they need the right fuel to keep up. A healthy diet, regular exercise, good hydration and sleep can make a big difference in their overall energy and mood. Studies have shown that teens who exercise regularly are less likely to suffer from depression and anxiety, leading to improved confidence and self-worth.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLady standing on scale.

Here’s why\n\n\n\n\n        The influence of social media\n\n\n            On social media, boys are constantly flooded with images of what they’re “supposed” to look or act like. Whether it’s Instagram influencers with chiseled bodies and “hot” women next to them or YouTube celebs showing off an exaggerated version of masculinity, it can be tough for boys not to compare themselves with the others. All this “influence” has led to adolescent boys feeling insecure about their bodies.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarol Yepes/Moment RF/Getty Images/File\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nAre ‘manfluencers’ raising our sons?\n\n\n\n\n            The answer is simple but often hard to do. Reducing social media use by 50% for three weeks led teens and young adults to feel much better about their weight and overall appearance, according to a 2023 study in the journal Psychology of Popular Media. (It’s just one of many studies showing the negative effects of social media and the positive effects of limiting its use.)\n    \n\n            Boys need to understand that what they see online isn’t always real. Filters, editing and highlight reels create a distorted view of reality. It’s vital we encourage boys to focus on being the best version of themselves — not trying to live up to an impossible standard set by others.\n    \n\n        Potential effects on fertility\n\n\n            As puberty hits, boys are likely not thinking about children or how their current habits will affect their future fertility. Smoking, drug use, poor diet, obesity — these all can contribute to fertility issues later in life. That’s why it’s never too early to start teaching boys how their lifestyle choices can affect their reproductive health.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCavan Images/Cavan Images RF/Getty Images/File\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nWhat men can do to maintain a healthy sex life\n\n\n\n\n        Encouraging open dialogue\n\n\n            At the end of the day, the most important thing we can do is keep the lines of communication open.

        "title": "‘High on the list of items’: Ramaswamy threat to claw back Rivian loan sparks criticism of Musk’s conflict of interest",
        "content": "CNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            Vivek Ramaswamy, the incoming co-chair of President-elect Donald Trump’s commission to cut government spending, has set his sights on money the Biden administration is dispersing in its final days in office, including a key loan to a rival company of his commission co-chair, Elon Musk.\n    \n\n            Last week, the Department of Energy announced a $6.6 billion conditional loan commitment to Rivian, the electric vehicle startup that is a nascent competitor to Tesla, Musk’s $1 trillion car company.\n    \n\n            Ramaswamy says that loan and others like it are “high on the list of items” that he will look to claw back once his cost-cutting commission, known as the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, gets going next year.\n    \n\n            “Those types of last-minute actions that are taking place in the lame duck merit particularly special scrutiny,” Ramaswamy told CNN.\n    \n\n            Since the election, Biden officials have continued to hand out billions of dollars in government-backed loans and other federal funds, much of it to finance clean energy and domestic chip manufacturing projects.\n    \n\n            It’s unclear whether Ramaswamy will make good on his promise to claw back that money, or what legal grounds he would use to justify it. Despite its broad mandate of cutting government waste, DOGE has no statutory authority and is essentially a presidential advisory commission that can make recommendations. Only Congress can claw back money it has previously approved.\n    \n\n            Still, Ramaswamy’s comments are seen as a warning shot. Not only do they open another front in what promises to be a tense battle over efforts to reduce the size of the federal government, they also highlight the potential conflicts that could arise as spending cuts bump against Musk’s vast business empire, which itself has benefitted from government assistance.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nReuters\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nBefore DOGE, Ramaswamy spent years attacking Musk for ties to China\n\n\n\n\n            For now, industry groups and lobbyists around Washington are in a wait-and-see mode, with some expressing skepticism over how seriously to take Ramaswamy’s threats.\n    \n\n            “I would say we’re a few steps from having to even potentially deal with this,” said one auto industry source, asking incredulously, “Is he going to be in the government?”\n    \n\n        Conflict of interest\n\n\n            The DOE loan to Rivian was in the works for two years and would help finance a new manufacturing plant in Georgia, which Rivian says would create some 7,500 full-time jobs. The loan is among 32 deals worth a total of nearly $55 billion that the DOE has doled out under Biden. All of that money eventually has to be repaid to the federal government, which isn’t on the hook unless companies go bankrupt.\n    \n\n            In speaking to CNN, Ramaswamy was cynical about the chances of taxpayers getting their money back and suggested the post-election timing of the loan was political.\n    \n\n            “There’s no way that that money will ever get paid back,” Ramaswamy said. “And If you’re seeing an uptick in the rate of expenditures going out the door in response to the election, that suggest politicization, and suggests a differential change in standard, which from the standpoint of protecting the taxpayer, we believe would be inappropriate.”\n    \n\n            The irony is that Tesla received a similar DOE loan for $465 million in 2010, a time when Musk’s company needed cash ahead of its first public sale of stock. The loan proved to be a game-changer for Tesla, which in 2013 ended up repaying it in full, nearly 10 years ahead of schedule.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nElon Musk attends the America First Policy Institute (AFPI) gala at Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., November 14, 2024.\n\nCarlos Barria/Reuters\n\n\n\n            “Tesla is the bright, shining example,” said Albert Gore,  executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association – an EV trade group that represents both Rivian and Tesla. “I think that it would be great to continue supporting that type of growth here in the US.”\n    \n\n            Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities says while it is legitimate for DOGE to review last minute loans, singling out federal funds going to a rival company of Musk is not a “one off” and will likely “become the norm.”\n    \n\n            “If Musk is your friend, it’s going to be a positive,” said Ives. “If he’s an enemy, it’s going to be a huge negative.”\n    \n\n            Neither Rivian nor its lobbyists commented on their plans should the loan not go through. In a statement to CNN, the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs director Jigar Shah said it would be “irresponsible for any government to turn its back” on private companies and communities that are receiving loans from the office.\n    \n\n            Though industry sources say they aren’t overly concerned about DOGE’s ability to claw back federal loan guarantees, Ramaswamy’s decision to single out the Rivian loan struck some as concerning.\n    \n\n            “If you’re going to claw back money based on the perception it’s going to a competitor of your co-chair, that will end up delegitimizing your place in this whole system,” the auto industry source said.\n    \n\n            Trump’s Energy Department could conceivably cancel the loan commitment to Rivian under certain circumstances, according to two lawyers familiar with the government loan program. The loan won’t be finalized until both the agency and Rivian satisfy certain conditions. Even still, it would be hard to cancel the deal without cause, said Mary Anne Sullivan, a former Energy Department lawyer in the Clinton Administration.\n    \n\n            “There’s so much room for judgment in whether the terms of the conditional commitment have been satisfied and so much room for judgment to decide whether the financial assumptions underlying the loan guarantee have changed,” she said.\n    \n\n        ‘Shoveling money out the door’\n\n\n            The Biden White House has spent much of the past year getting money out the door from a series of domestic spending bills the president signed while in office.\n    \n\n            As of October, there’s still about $288 billion from the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law that won’t be available until fiscal year 2025 or later, and $14.8 billion from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which contains much of the clean energy projects funded under Biden.\n    \n\n            There are legal guardrails to ensure that money continues to be spent through the Impoundment Control Act, which limits the White House from withholding funds already appropriated by Congress.\n    \n\n            But Trump made the use of impoundment authority – a practice where the executive branch unilaterally refuses to spend money already appropriated by Congress – a cornerstone of his presidential campaign’s pledge to impose fiscal discipline.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nIt’s not just Democrats — Republicans are working to Trump-proof their climate money\n\n\n\n\n            “All of the trillions of dollars that are sitting there not yet spent, we will redirect that money for important projects like roads, bridges, dams and we will not allow it to be spent on the meaningless green new scam ideas,” Trump said in his Republican National Convention speech.\n    \n\n            Doing so would set up a direct confrontation with lawmakers in both parties, who closely guard their authority over federal spending. It would also almost certainly trigger a high stakes court battle.\n    \n\n            Trump has already taken steps to make good on that pledge by nominating Russell Vought to lead the Office of Management and Budget. Vought, who served as Trump’s OMB director in his first term, drafted the 25-page chapter detailing an expansive view of executive authority in the conservative playbook Project 2025.\n    \n\n            The White House may try to lean on Republicans in Congress, where lawmakers can claw back money that’s been previously approved, so long as it hasn’t been obligated by the White House. Last year, as part of the deal to address the debt ceiling, Democratic lawmakers agreed to rescind $20 billion of the $80 billion they provided to the Internal Revenue Service.\n    \n\n            But they may face resistance, particularly when it comes to clean energy money included in the IRA. Even though no Republicans voted for the bill, close to 80% of announced clean energy investments are in Republican districts.\n    \n\n            Industry and advocacy groups in the clean energy sector are already reaching out to GOP lawmakers to highlight the benefits – including funding and jobs – that the loan program, as well as the energy tax credits approved in the IRA.\n    \n\n            “It’s a much more targeted and much more urgent effort,” said one clean energy industry insider.\n    \n\n            At an Energy Department conference in Washington on Wednesday, White House senior adviser John Podesta talked about the need to “keep shoveling money out the door” until inauguration.\n    \n\n            “We, by the way, plan to get more done by the end of this month. We read the papers, we know that the next four years will bring a lot more uncertainty to federal clean energy policy,” said Podesta. “No one can reverse the momentum that we’ve created together.”",

        "content": "Washington\nCNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            President-elect Donald Trump has named Billy Long, a former Republican congressman from Missouri, to head the Internal Revenue Service, signaling plans to oust current Commissioner Danny Werfel before his term expires in 2027.\n    \n\n            Replacing Werfel, who was picked by President Joe Biden, could mean a major shift at the agency, which has been undergoing a massive transformation that’s become a political football in Washington.\n    \n\n            Democrats have argued the agency, after facing years of budget cuts, needs more money to go after tax cheats and modernize its technology. And Republicans, many of whom – including Long – have supported shutting down the agency altogether, are skeptical that new enforcement actions won’t unfairly target middle-class Americans.\n    \n\n            Last year, Republican lawmakers successfully clawed back $20 billion of the $80 billion provided to the IRS by the Democrat-backed Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022.\n    \n\n            Further cuts to the IRS’ budget could be a priority for Trump, who has put Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy in charge of a new commission to cut federal spending.\n    \n\n        IRS revamp could slow\n\n\n            While the Inflation Reduction Act spells out how much money can be used for enforcement activities and taxpayer assistance, it’s largely up to the IRS, which is housed in the Department of Treasury, to decide how exactly the money is spent.\n    \n\n            One of the biggest projects under Werfel – the launch of a free tax filing program called Direct File – doesn’t have the backing of many GOP lawmakers, some of whom have criticized the program as “illegitimate and unnecessary.”\n    \n\n            There are Republicans who have also voiced concern about the effort to ramp up enforcement. Some, including Trump, have misleadingly suggested that the IRS is hiring 87,000 new auditors to target middle-class Americans and small business owners.\n    \n\n            But Democrats say the IRS needs the influx of money to successfully go after tax cheats. Prior to the Inflation Reduction Act, the agency did not have the staffing or resources to pursue high-income earners that the agency knew owed taxes, Werfel said earlier this year.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal Revenue Service Commissioner Daniel Werfel testifies before the House Ways and Means Committee in the Longworth House Office Building on Capitol Hill on February 15 in Washington, DC.\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            So far, the IRS has collected nearly $1.3 billion in overdue taxes from wealthy households due to the new enforcement efforts.\n    \n\n            Less controversial efforts undertaken under Werfel’s leadership have been aimed at making it easier for Americans to file their federal taxes, like hiring thousands more customer service representatives and updating the agency’s archaic technology so that it can digitize paper forms.\n    \n\n            The independent Congressional Budget Office and other budget experts say that spending money on tax enforcement can reduce the deficit by bringing in more tax revenue.\n    \n\n        Long’s tax experience\n\n\n            Long served 12 years in the House of Representatives from 2011 to 2023. He ran unsuccessfully for a Senate seat in 2022.\n    \n\n            During his time in Congress, Long served on the Energy and Commerce Committee, the Homeland Security Committee and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee – but not on the House’s main tax-writing committee.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this 2014 photo, then-Rep. Billy Long questions witnesses during a House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee hearing in Washington, DC.\n\nAndrew Harrer/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            He co-sponsored, along with dozens of other Republicans, bills to abolish the IRS and replace the federal income tax system with a national sales tax.\n    \n\n            Long currently works as a certified tax and business adviser, according to his X bio. “DM me to save 40% on your taxes. We have a new traunch of tax credits just out!” it says.\n    \n\n            “Since leaving Congress, Billy has worked as a Business and Tax advisor, helping Small Businesses navigate the complexities of complying with the IRS Rules and Regulations,” Trump said in a statement Wednesday announcing his pick.\n    \n\n            In the private sector, Long has been helping people file for the employee retention tax credit, a pandemic-era benefit. The IRS temporarily paused processing of those claims in 2023 amid concerns of fraud.\n    \n\n            In a 2023 podcast interview, Long talked about how he only helps people who are eligible to claim the tax credit.\n    \n\n            “If they don’t qualify, we do not tell them they do. And we do not to get them through the process,” he said.\n    \n\n            “Taxpayers and the wonderful employees of the IRS will love having Billy at the helm. He is the consummate ‘people person,’ well respected on both sides of the aisle,” Trump said in his statement.\n    \n\n            A former professional auctioneer, Long once used his skills to drown out a protester who was disrupting a committee hearing on Capitol Hill.",

        "content": "CNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            Chelsea Manning, the former Army intelligence analyst behind one of the largest leaks of classified information in history, was among a group of activists arrested Thursday outside of House Speaker Mike Johnson’s office after taking part in a protest advocating for transgender rights.\n    \n\n            The protest took place outside of Johnson’s office in the Cannon House Office Building. It comes after Johnson supported a GOP-led effort to ban transgender women from using women’s restrooms at the US Capitol, and one day after transgender rights took center stage in a high-profile case at the Supreme Court.\n    \n\n            “I’m here today because every person deserves dignity and respect, both in daily life and in more symbolic places like the U.S. Capitol,” Manning, who is a transgender woman, said in a statement to CNN.\n    \n\n            “As someone who has fought against similar rules, I know what it’s like to feel pushed aside and erased,” Manning said. “But I also know the incredible power and resilience our community has. I’m not here as a leader or a spokesperson but simply as another member of my community who shows up unconditionally to support my siblings in this fight. I will stand beside them no matter what. We didn’t start this fight, but we are together now.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA group of protesters advocating for transgender rights were arrested after protesting outside of House Speaker Mike Johnson's Cannon office on Thursday, December 5.\n\nCNN\n\n\n\n            A contentious debate came to a head on Capitol Hill last month after GOP Rep. Nancy Mace filed a resolution to prevent transgender women from using women’s bathrooms in the US Capitol. The move by Mace came after Democratic Rep.-elect Sarah McBride became the first out transgender woman elected to Congress.\n    \n\n            The US Capitol Police told CNN that around 15 people were arrested as a result of the protest on Thursday. It is against the law to protest inside congressional office buildings or inside the US Capitol.\n    \n\n            Other protestors could be heard on Thursday shouting a number of things, including “Democrats, grow a spine, trans lives are on the line.”\n    \n\n            Johnson’s office in Cannon is directly across from the women’s bathroom.\n    \n\n            Manning was convicted in 2013 of stealing 750,000 pages of classified documents and videos and disseminating them to WikiLeaks, the online anti-secrecy group. In 2017, then-President Barack Obama commuted Manning’s sentence.",

Kennedy Airport and noted Dali was turned away at a Transportation Security Administration security checkpoint because she didn’t have a boarding pass, according to the complaint. But five minutes later she returned and was able to get past the TSA checkpoint by going to a lane for airline employees.\n    \n\n            She proceeded to a departing gate where “Delta agents, who were busy helping ticketed passengers board, did not stop her or ask her to present a boarding pass before she boarded the plane,” the complaint said.\n    \n\n            Attempting to stay undiscovered, she hid in the bathroom to remain out of the crew’s sight, according to one passenger account.\n    \n\n            “I overheard the flight attendants talking about it with the pilots,” New York City real estate broker Rob Jackson told CNN. “They said this person was in one lavatory and then would exit and walk to a different lavatory and go in there for a long time.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelta Airlines planes stand at their JFK terminal 4 two days before the official start of Thanksgiving holiday, New York, NY, November 26, 2024.

Kennedy Airport and noted Dali was turned away at a Transportation Security Administration security checkpoint because she didn’t have a boarding pass, according to the complaint. But five minutes later she returned and was able to get past the TSA checkpoint by going to a lane for airline employees.\n    \n\n            She proceeded to a departing gate where “Delta agents, who were busy helping ticketed passengers board, did not stop her or ask her to present a boarding pass before she boarded the plane,” the complaint said.\n    \n\n            Attempting to stay undiscovered, she hid in the bathroom to remain out of the crew’s sight, according to one passenger account.\n    \n\n            “I overheard the flight attendants talking about it with the pilots,” New York City real estate broker Rob Jackson told CNN. “They said this person was in one lavatory and then would exit and walk to a different lavatory and go in there for a long time.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelta Airlines planes stand at their JFK terminal 4 two days before the official start of Thanksgiving holiday, New York, NY, November 26, 2024. More than 80 million travelers are expected to take the roads, trains and sky, with 6 million expected to fly.

They may be here now and they directed us to keep everyone on the airplane until we sort out the extra passenger that’s on the plane.”\n    \n\n            Dali was detained by French police, who found she was ineligible to enter the country and ordered her to be sent back to the US.\n    \n\n        Who is Svetlana Dali and what do we know about her?\n\n\n            Records indicate Dali once lived in the Philadelphia area.\n    \n\n            Authorities have not said whether she had tried to sneak onto a plane before, or if she was previously known to law enforcement.

        "title": "Memphis police ‘harm and demean’ people, DOJ says after issuing scathing report calling for reforms",
        "content": "CNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            A scathing report from the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division found the Memphis Police Department engages in a pattern of discriminatory policing, including violence against the disabled, and regularly violates the constitutional rights of its residents, particularly Black people.\n    \n\n            Historically, similar reports by the feds have led to the overhaul of local police departments with federal monitoring agreements known as consent decrees. However, in a letter responding to the DOJ’s claims, the city of Memphis said it’s not ready to accept the findings, and the police chief said her department has made hundreds of changes in recent years to “improve officer response.”\n    \n\n            The investigation found the Memphis Police Department “engages in a pattern or practice of using excessive force, conducting unlawful stops, searches and arrests and discriminatory policing of Black people and residents with behavioral health disabilities,” the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said in the report.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemetrius Haley, Tadarrius Bean and Justin Smith are seen outside of the federal courthouse in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nGeorge Walker IV/AP\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\n3 officers convicted of witness tampering in Tyre Nichols fatal beating but acquitted of most serious charge\n\n\n\n\n            In one of the most egregious examples in the report, an 8-year-old Black boy with behavioral health issues was grabbed by the responding police officer, lifted into the air and thrown onto a couch.\n    \n\n            “Memphis police officers handcuff children as young as 8-years-old even when they pose no safety risk,” the report said.\n    \n\n            The investigation into the Memphis Police Department was launched 17 months ago after motorist Tyre Nichols’ violent beating death. Officers repeatedly punched, kicked and dragged Nichols during his arrest after a 2023 traffic stop, video of the incident showed.\n    \n\n            Five officers were fired, arrested on state murder charges and indicted on federal civil rights and witness tampering charges. The encounter prompted renewed national debate on justice in policing and reform and spurred protests and vigils in Memphis and other major US cities.\n    \n\n            Speaking at a Thursday morning news conference, Clarke said the actions of Memphis police “harm and demean people and they promote distrust undermining the fundamental safety mission of a police department.”\n    \n\n            “Let me be clear, these tactics do not make Memphis safer,” Clarke added.\n    \n\n            Memphis Mayor Paul Young said his administration “takes the DOJ findings seriously, and we’ll review this report with an open mind to the recommendations.”\n    \n\n            Police will “continue and expand” on adjustments already made, and the city can lean on community input and independent national experts, Young said Thursday at a news conference.\n    \n\n            “We agree that our police department should always strive for improvement,” Young said. “However, we don’t believe that the consent decree is the most effective way or efficient way to achieve the results that our community needs and deserves.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this still taken from video released by the City of Memphis, a police officer is at the scene following the beating of Tyre Nichols. The SCORPION unit, which falls under the Organized Crime unit, was permanently disbanded after the video's release.\n\nCity of Memphis\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nMemphis squashed its SCORPION unit but many other cities rely on special squads, even after their own controversies\n\n\n\n\n            Asked at the news conference about the city’s response, acting US Attorney Reagan Taylor Fondren said, “We hope to work with the city to implement the necessary reforms.”\n    \n\n            With a consent decree, a judge can keep tabs on a police department to make sure it’s in compliance to the court-ordered agreement. The purpose is to hold police departments accused of misconduct accountable.\n    \n\n            Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn “C.J.” Davis said her department has already worked to make changes.\n    \n\n            “In the last three years, we have changed over 700 policies… that help to direct process, help to improve officer response. Community engagement has been a significant part of the work we have been doing,” Davis said during a news conference Wednesday.\n    \n\n            The city of Memphis’ response to the DOJ report comes as President-elect Donald Trump is about to re-take control of the Justice Department. During the previous Trump administration these types of oversight and monitoring agreements were abandoned.\n    \n\n            Asked about the timing, Fondren said, “The mission of the Department of Justice is to protect civil rights for all people, so the career employees of the Department of Justice and federal prosecutors of the United States Attorney’s Office will continue that mission through any administration.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTyre Nichols\n\nProvided by Ben Crump\n\n\n\n            Incidents like the one involving Nichols are addressed in the 73-page report saying, “MPD officers regularly escalate encounters involving nonviolent offenses and use unreasonable force against unarmed people who pose no threat.”\n    \n\n            “Officers use disproportionate force against people who have committed, at most, minor offenses such as traffic infractions, and use force even after people are restrained,” the report continues.\n    \n\n            Those actions mirror what was seen in videos released as part of the investigation into the beating death of Nichols.\n    \n\n            The Rev. Earle J. Fisher, senior pastor of Abyssinian Baptist Church in Memphis, had “a bunch of mixed emotions” about the release of the report, he said.\n    \n\n            “It is hard to feel any level of vindication,” Fisher told CNN’s Jim Acosta Thursday morning. “What you see in this report is there is a system and structure in place. And I hope that the city administration can find a way to work more directly with the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, and find something that they can be held accountable to.”\n    \n\n            State Democratic Rep. Justin Jones questioned what ultimately becomes of the DOJ’s civil rights investigation.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA patch of the Memphis Police Department is seen during a meeting of the Peace Officers Standards and Training Commission Thursday, May 18, 2023 in Nashville, Tenn. A Tennessee commission that enforces standards for police recommended Thursday that proceedings to bar an officer charged in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols from serving in state law enforcement be suspended until his legal case is resolved.

The other three officers were convicted in October of witness tampering related to the cover-up of the beating. Ex-officers Tadarrius Bean and Justin Smith were acquitted of civil rights charges of using excessive force and being indifferent to Nichols’ serious injuries, AP reported.\n    \n\n            A fifth former officer, Demetrius Haley, was acquitted of violating Nichols’ civil rights causing death, but he was convicted of two lesser charges of violating his civil rights causing bodily injury, according to AP. All five men face sentencing by a federal judge in the coming months.\n    \n\n            Martin and Mills also are expected to change their not-guilty pleas in state court, according to lawyers involved in the case, AP reported. Bean, Haley and Smith have pleaded not guilty to state charges of second-degree murder. A trial in the state case is set for April 28.\n    \n\n            Nichols’ death raised many questions about policing practices in general and specifically in Tennessee.\n    \n\n            Notably the Memphis City Council passed the “Driving Equality Act in Honor of Tyre Nichols,” which prohibited police stops for minor infractions.\n    \n\n            The Memphis measure was eventually blocked when the Republican-controlled Tennessee legislature passed a bill “that prohibits or limits the ability of a law enforcement agency to take all necessary steps that are lawful under state and federal law to fulfill the law enforcement agency’s duties to prevent and detect crime and apprehend criminal offenders.”\n    \n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\n\n  CNN’s Ryan Young contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Amazon secretly stopped fast deliveries to 2 predominantly Black ZIP codes, District of Columbia says",
        "content": "AP\n         — \n    \n\n\n            The District of Columbia sued Amazon on Wednesday, alleging the company secretly stopped providing its fastest delivery service to residents of two predominantly Black neighborhoods while still charging millions of dollars for a membership that promises the benefit.\n    \n\n            The complaint filed in District of Columbia Superior Court revolves around Amazon’s Prime membership, which costs consumers $139 per year or $14.99 per month for fast deliveries — including one-day, two-day and same-day shipments — along with other enhancements.\n    \n\n            In mid-2022, the lawsuit alleges, the Seattle-based online retailer imposed what it called a delivery “exclusion” on two low-income ZIP codes in the district — 20019 and 20020 — and began relying exclusively on third-party delivery services such as UPS and the U.S. Postal Service, rather than its own delivery systems.\n    \n\n            Amazon says it made the change based on concerns about driver safety.\n    \n\n            “There have been specific and targeted acts against drivers delivering Amazon packages” in the two ZIP codes and the company made the change to “put the safety of delivery drivers first,” Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a prepared statement.\n    \n\n            “We made the deliberate choice to adjust our operations, including delivery routes and times, for the sole reason of protecting the safety of drivers,” Nantel said. “The claims made by the attorney general, that our business practices are somehow discriminatory or deceptive, are categorically false.”\n    \n\n            The District of Columbia’s attorney general’s office alleged the company never told Prime members in the two ZIP codes about the change even though they experienced slower deliveries as a result. Amazon also did not tell new customers about the exclusions when they signed up for Prime memberships, the lawsuit says.\n    \n\n            “Amazon is charging tens of thousands of hard-working Ward 7 and 8 residents for an expedited delivery service it promises but does not provide,” District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb said in a statement, referencing the two areas in the city where Amazon is accused of excluding its speediest deliveries.\n    \n\n            “While Amazon has every right to make operational changes, it cannot covertly decide that a dollar in one ZIP code is worth less than a dollar in another,” Schwalb said.\n    \n\n            The lawsuit says Amazon has nearly 50,000 Prime members who live in the two ZIP codes, a number that represents nearly half of the population. Prime members in those neighborhoods have ordered more than 4.5 million packages in the past four years, and are more likely to rely on Amazon since they have fewer services and retail stores nearby, the city said. The area is also a notorious food desert.\n    \n\n            The district says that in 2021, before Amazon implemented its delivery “exclusion,” more than 72% of Prime packages in the impacted ZIP codes were delivered within two days. But last year, it was only 24%, according to the complaint.\n    \n\n            Meanwhile, the district’s lawsuit says Prime members who lived in other parts of the city received two-day deliveries 75% of the time. Amazon was also improving its delivery speeds nationwide.\n    \n\n            When some customers in the city complained about the slower deliveries, Amazon concealed the true reason for the delays and “deceptively implied” that the delays “were simply due to natural fluctuations in shipping circumstances, rather than an affirmative decision by Amazon,” the lawsuit says.\n    \n\n            District officials are asking the court to issue an order prohibiting Amazon from “engaging in unfair or deceptive practices.” They also want the company to pay restitution or damages to affected Prime members, as well as civil penalties.\n    \n\n            This isn’t the first time Amazon has been accused of offering slower deliveries to some places where Black people make up most of the households.\n    \n\n            In 2016, American news outlet Bloomberg published an investigation that said Black residents of cities like Atlanta and Chicago were about half as likely as white residents to live in neighborhoods with access to Amazon’s same-day delivery service.\n    \n\n            Local news website DCist reported a year later that Amazon’s restaurant delivery service — which the company shut down five years ago — had excluded some neighborhoods in Washington, including one of the ZIP codes mentioned in the district’s lawsuit.\n    \n\n            Nantel said Amazon is “always transparent” with its customers “during the shopping journey and checkout process about when, exactly, they can expect their orders to arrive.”\n    \n\n            Since 2022, nearly 1.5 million Prime-eligible products were delivered in two days or less to Prime customers residing in the two ZIP codes, the company said.\n    \n\n            “What we’d like to do, and have offered, is to work together with the attorney general and their office in an effort to reduce crime and improve safety in these areas,” Nantel aid. “Nevertheless, we will proceed in the process and demonstrate that providing fast and accurate delivery times and prioritizing the safety of customers and delivery partners are not mutually exclusive.”\n    \n\n            The complaint filed Wednesday represents the second major legal battle between Amazon and the District of Columbia which also filed an antitrust lawsuit against the company.",

There are various ways to suspend President Yoon’s authority,” he told CNN.\n    \n\n            Ryu added that Han is meeting with Yoon on Friday afternoon.\n    \n\n            Han had earlier vowed to work to prevent the presidential impeachment to “avoid unprepared chaos and harm to the people.”\n    \n\n            In an interview with CNN on Thursday, Han criticized the main opposition party for moving forward on its efforts to impeach the president, accusing the liberal Democratic Party of “prioritizing their political interests over the potential damage and instability this rushed impeachment could bring to the people.”\n    \n\n            Nevertheless, Han said he had no intention to defend Yoon’s mistakes and had requested the president to quit the People Power Party.\n    \n\n            Han, who has openly criticized Yoon’s decree as “unconstitutional,” said he met with the president on Wednesday and told him that what happened Tuesday evening had “left a big scar on Korea and our party.”\n    \n\n        ‘Maturity of South Korea’s democracy’\n\n\n            Like many high-ranking officials, ruling party politicians and presidential aides, Han was not notified in advance of the martial law declaration.

        "content": "CNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            Ghanaians will go to the polls on Saturday to elect their next president, as the West African country grapples with its worst economic situation in decades.\n    \n\n            Twelve candidates are vying for the presidency, as the current incumbent, Nana Akufo-Addo, reaches his two-term limit.\n    \n\n            But the frontrunners are seen as two men from Ghana’s two dominant parties: the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC).\n    \n\n            Opinion polls indicate that voters are split between current vice president Mahamudu Bawumia, 61, and former one-term president John Mahama, 66, who hopes to achieve a comeback similar to that achieved by US President-elect Donald Trump.\n    \n\n            “The economy is a priority for the electorates,” Godfred Bokpin, an economist and professor of finance at the University of Ghana Business School, told CNN.\n    \n\n            But other issues such as high unemployment and a crisis over illegal gold mining, known locally as “galamsey” will also influence how voters cast their ballots, said Kwame Asah-Asante, a political science lecturer at the University of Ghana.\n    \n\n        Rising poverty levels\n\n\n            Ghanaians have been railing against environmental degradation caused by unlicensed small-scale mining, a longstanding issue that has left large swathes of land pockmarked by pits and major rivers polluted.\n    \n\n            Over the years, illegal mining sites have proliferated despite efforts by successive governments to rein in galamsey, including military deployments by the current government to shut it down.\n    \n\n            High inflation, youth unemployment and a steep increase in the cost of living are believed to be its main drivers amid a global surge in gold prices. According to data from the Ghana Statistical Service, more than 1.3 million people aged between 15 and 35 were unemployed as of September last year.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Akosua Galamsey\n\nNimi Princewill/CNN\n\n\n\n\nRelated card\nA price too high to pay? Pollution from Ghana’s gold rush sparks maternal health fears\n\n\n\n\n            The country’s economy is also reeling from the shock of the Covid-19 pandemic, which triggered “a rise in poverty levels since 2020,” according to the World Bank.\n    \n\n            It added in an October report that “weak economic growth, limited government spending, and high inflation - particularly in food prices - have worsened living standards, pushing more people into poverty, and increasing the risk of food insecurity.”\n    \n\n            In December 2022, Ghana’s inflation rate hit 54.1% year-on-year - its highest rate in more than two decades - spurring protests over alleged economic mismanagement.\n    \n\n            In the same year, Ghana’s central bank recorded a loss of 60.8 billion cedi (more than $5 billion at the time). The country also suffered other economic shocks such as the depreciation of its currency, mounting debts, and a federal budget “weakened by high energy sector costs” amid “low public revenues,” the World Bank said last year.\n    \n\n            “If the economy had gone well, I don’t think the opposition would have stood any chance because when it comes to the economic jargon, nobody understands it better than (current vice president and presidential candidate) Bawumia,” economist Bokpin said about the potential impact the economic hardships may have had on the ruling party’s popularity.\n    \n\n            Bawumia, a UK-trained economist, has been the poster boy of the government’s economic policies, chairing its economic management team.\n    \n\n            In response to criticism over his handling of the country’s struggling economy, Bawumia has absolved himself from the blame, saying in February that his role was advisory and without decision-making powers.\n    \n\n            Bawumia has also been criticized by his rival, Mahama, for saying little about the economy during his campaigns.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupporters hold a placard depicting the portrait of Mahamudu Bawumia, in Takoradi, on August 18, 2024.\n\nNipah Dennis/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            “His strategy has been to dissociate himself from the economic fallouts,” Bokpin said of Bawumia.\n    \n\n            Analyst Asah-Asante said that Bawumia’s record on the economy had become “both a blessing and a curse to him” in the run-up to the election.\n    \n\n            His campaign spokesperson, Denis Miracles Aboagye, acknowledged there had been challenges.\n    \n\n            “We haven’t had the best of days when it comes to the economy between 2020 and 2024,” he told CNN. “Inflation went all the way to 54%, we fought so hard to bring it down to 21%. We (initially) took it from 15% (under Mahama’s government), so it (the current inflation rate) is not the best,” he said, adding: “We’ve had challenges with the exchange rates where it’s been quite volatile.”\n    \n\n            The statistical service announced Wednesday that the country’s annual inflation rate had risen to 23%, the highest in six months, with just days to the election.\n    \n\n            Aboagye said the current government had performed strongly on road infrastructure, health, education and tackling unemployment, however, adding that more than 2.3 million jobs had been created.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupporters of National Democratic Congress (NDC) presidential candidate John Mahama react during his final election campaign rally, in Accra, Ghana December 5, 2024.\n\nZohra Bensemra/Reuters\n\n\n\n            Bawumia’s manifesto also boasts of providing stable electricity for almost eight years after lingering power cuts that blighted Mahama’s first stint in office between 2012 and 2017.\n    \n\n            Local studies said the power shortages – known in Ghana as “dumsor” – cost the country millions of dollars in lost revenue in that period.\n    \n\n            “The dumsor under Mahama was so severe, it continues to bring back painful memories to those who lost their economic livelihoods,” Asah-Asante said.\n    \n\n            A national spokesperson for Mahama’s NDC party did not respond to CNN’s multiple requests for interview.\n    \n\n        A reset or upgrade?\n\n\n            Mahama has vowed at campaign rallies to “reset” the nation on a path “for good governance and accountability” if he wins back his job.\n    \n\n            He touts successes in cutting unemployment rates and boosting press freedom during his time in office. If given another term, Mahama pledges to run a small but efficient government and bring down taxes within three months. He also plans to ban illegal mining and introduce a 24-hour economy to create jobs.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Ghana President, John Mahama, speaks on the stage during the final rally of the NDC in Accra on December 5, 2024.\n\nOlympia de Maismont/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            Bawumia promises to reduce the cost of living by “stabilizing the prices of foods produced locally” and digitalizing the country’s economy. He also plans to enforce safer mining practices, among other initiatives, if elected.\n    \n\n            More than half of Ghana’s 34 million people are registered to vote in this year’s election and many are clamoring for change.\n    \n\n            “I hope and pray that we should have a government that would listen to the plight of the people, a government that would have the magic wand to turn things around and make Ghana a better place for us,” Asah-Asante said.\n    \n\n            The presidential poll will be held alongside a vote for members of parliament.\n    \n\n            To win the presidency, a candidate must secure more than 50% of the total votes cast. If no candidate wins an absolute majority in the first round of voting, a run-off election will be held for the two highest-placing candidates.\n    \n\n            Asah-Asante expects a closely fought election between the two frontrunners but is hopeful that power will be peacefully transferred to whoever wins, in line with Ghana’s long-standing democratic tradition.\n    \n\n            “I’m optimistic that the people of Ghana will vote massively for democracy… and whoever loses the election would accept defeat and abide by the rules of the game and the country should be calm after election for us to continue the journey towards an endured democracy,” he said.",

        "content": "Sydney, Australia\nCNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            Police are searching for two masked suspects after a synagogue was set on fire in southeastern Australia early Friday in an attack condemned by the prime minister as an act of antisemitism.\n    \n\n            Worshippers fled from the Adass Israel Synagogue in Melbourne when the blaze took hold around 4 a.m. Friday morning. The synagogue regularly holds overnight prayers.\n    \n\n            “There was banging on the door, some liquid was thrown inside and was lit alight. The few people inside the synagogue ran outside the back door. One of them got burned,” said a board member from the synagogue Benjamin Klein, speaking to national broadcaster the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).\n    \n\n            “The whole place took alight pretty quickly,” Klein said.\n    \n\n            Officers from the Victoria Police Arson and Explosives Squad are investigating what they say was a deliberate attack on one of Australia’s most significant Jewish centers.\n    \n\n            Speaking to reporters Friday, Detective Inspector Chris Murray said two figures were seen “spreading an accelerant of some type inside the premises.”\n    \n\n            Murray said the attack was “targeted” but stopped short of labeling the alleged arson a terror attack.\n    \n\n            “We’re not ruling anything in or out,” Murray said, acknowledging that he was “personally worried” about the rise in antisemitic attacks.\n    \n\n            Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was quick to condemn the attack as a clear act of antisemitism.\n    \n\n            “It’s a terrible morning to awake to this news which all Australians should unequivocally condemn,” he said during an interview with public broadcaster ABC. “This is an outrage. The violence and intimidation and destruction at a place of worship is something that we should never see in Australia. It’s risk lives, it’s clearly aimed at creating fear in the community.”\n    \n\n            Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza has exacerbated tension between pro-Israel and pro-Palestine groups in Australia, leading Albanese’s government to appoint a Special Envoy to Combat Antisemitism and a Special Envoy on Social Cohesion.\n    \n\n            Jewish communities across Australia have called out a drastic increase in antisemitic attacks and behavior since the war began on October 7, 2023.  \n\n\n            Since then, the government has spent 25 million Australian dollars ($16 million) on increased safety and security at Jewish sites across the country, and has introduced other measures to target religious hate crime.\n    \n\n            “There is legislation now before Parliament to criminalize hate speech, including the urging or threatening of force or violence against individuals or groups because of who they are or what they believe, and we’ll continue to be vigilant on this issue,” Albanese detailed Friday.\n    \n\n            However, Robert Gregory, CEO of the Australian Jewish Association, said he was “outraged but not at all surprised” by the attack. He said the community had been warning the government about rising antisemitism for over a year and not enough had been done to combat it.\n    \n\n            Sarah Schwartz, executive officer of the Jewish Council of Australia, called the fire an “act of disgusting violence” and an attack on the Jewish community.\n    \n\n            “No one should be unsafe in a place of worship,” she added.",

        "content": "Tokyo\nCNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            The Japanese capital is set to introduce a four-day workweek for government employees, in its latest push to help working mothers and boost record-low fertility rates.\n    \n\n            The Tokyo Metropolitan Government says the new arrangement, which begins in April, could give employees three days off every week. It separately announced another policy that will allow parents with children in grades one to three in elementary schools to trade off a bit of their salary for the option to clock out early.\n    \n\n            “We will review work styles … with flexibility, ensuring no one has to give up their career due to life events such as childbirth or childcare,” said Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike when she unveiled the plan in a policy speech on Wednesday.\n    \n\n            “Now is the time for Tokyo to take the initiative to protect and enhance the lives, livelihoods and economy of our people during these challenging times for the nation,” she added.\n    \n\nJapan’s fertility rate, which has seen a precipitous fall for many years, reached another record low in June, even as the government ramped up efforts to encourage young people to get married and start families.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTokyo Governor Yuriko Koike speaks to the media after winning the Tokyo gubernatorial election in Tokyo, Japan, on July 07, 2024.\n\nTomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images/File\n\n\n\n            Only 727,277 births were recorded last year, with the fertility rate - the number of children a woman has in her lifetime - dropping to a fresh low of 1.2, according to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. For a population to remain stable, it needs a fertility rate of 2.1.\n    \n\n            The Japanese government has been pushing for a raft of “now or never” policies to reverse the population crisis, including ensuring men to take paternity leaves, while other local governments have also introduced measures to improve work conditions.\n    \n\n            Many sociologists attribute the ever-plunging birth rates to Japan’s unforgiving work culture and rising costs of living. Grueling hours have long been a problem for corporate Japan where workers often suffer from health hazards and, in extreme cases, “karoshi,” a term meaning death by over work. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nThis community’s quarter century without a newborn shows the scale of Japan’s population crisis\n\n\n\n\n            As in other countries, women are often under pressure to choose between their career or family, but Japan’s unique overtime work culture makes pregnancy and raising children especially daunting.\n    \n\n            In fact, according to the World Bank, the gender gap in the country’s labor force participation, which stood at 55% for women and 72% for men last year, is higher than other high-income nations.\n    \n\n            The shift to a four-day workweek has sparked growing interest in the West, where some companies are beginning to explore compressed hours as a way to attract talent seeking better work-life balance. Some studies have shown that it improves well-being and productivity among workers.\n    \n\n            But the idea is still seen as radical for Japanese companies, which often equates time spent at work with loyalty for the company.\n    \n\n            And Tokyo isn’t the only place in Asia to implement more family friendly policies. Earlier this year, Singapore introduced new guidelines requiring all firms to consider requests by employees for flexible-working arrangements. That could include four-day weeks or flexible hours.",

        "content": "CNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            Vivek Ramaswamy, the co-chair of the proposed Department of Government Efficiency alongside billionaire Elon Musk, has a lengthy history of attacking his partnerâs ties to China, frequently referring to Musk as a âcircus monkeyâ and a puppet for the Chinese Communist Party.\n    \n\n            Ramaswamyâs critiques, reviewed by CNNâs KFile, include pointed remarks about Muskâs 2022 suggestion that Taiwan should become a special administrative region of China, a stance aligned with Beijingâs interests and one that drew praise from Chinese officials.\n    \n\n            Teslaâs investments in the Chinese market and Muskâs comment on Taiwan have drawn fierce criticism from Ramaswamy, who argued the Tesla CEO was pandering to the Chinese Communist Party for business benefits, such as regulatory approvals and tax breaks.\n    \n\n            âI think Tesla is increasingly beholden to China,â Ramaswamy said in May 2023 when discussing the carmakerâs decision to build a battery plant in Shanghai.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and guests at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket on November 19, 2024 in Brownsville, Texas. SpaceXâs billionaire owner, Elon Musk, a Trump confidante, has been tapped to lead the new Department of Government Efficiency alongside former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nBrandon Bell/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nMusk and Ramaswamy suggest ending time changes, reviving an effort that has failed in the past\n\n\n\n\n            âI have no reason to think Elon wonât jump like a circus monkey when Xi Jinping calls in the hour of need,â Ramaswamy added, referring to the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and president of China.\n    \n\n            Tesla is deeply reliant on China, with deliveries from its Shanghai facility accounting for more than half its global sales in 2023.\n    \n\n            In their collaboration within the Department of Governmental Efficiency, or DOGE, Musk and Ramaswamy share a goal of cutting federal regulations and reducing the federal workforce. But Muskâs role as the leader of companies with lucrative government contracts has sparked concerns about his potential conflicts of interest.\n    \n\n            Ramaswamyâs own words could be used by critics to question Muskâs role as a government cost-cutter, given how much his own companies have benefited over the years from billions of dollars in government contracts and assistance.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVivek Ramaswamy speaks at the Republican National Convention on July 16, 2024, in Milwaukee.\n\nLeon Neal/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            âBoth Tesla and SpaceX quite likely would not exist as successful businesses if it were not for the use of public funding, either through subsidies, through the electric car industry, or through actual government contracting in the case of SpaceX,â Ramaswamy said in 2022 on a Fox News podcast.\n\n\n            Though Musk, the worldâs richest man, and Ramaswamy, himself a millionaire, are both seen as friends of Big Tech, the two have divergent views when it comes to China. While Musk has recently favored closer ties, Ramaswamy has called for an economic decoupling from China.\n    \n\n            As a presidential candidate in the 2024 GOP primary, Ramaswamy was often critical of US economic ties to China. While he claimed other companies such as Apple and Black Rock were enabling and making political concessions to China, he often singled out Musk for some of his harshest criticism.\n    \n\n            âElon Musk has, I think, demonstrated his willingness to change his political tunes based on the favors that he gets to be able to do business in China,â Ramaswamy added on the 2022 Fox News podcast.\n    \n\n        Examining potential for DOGE partnership\n\n\n            CNNâs KFile reviewed Ramaswamyâs comments on Musk when looking into how the two might operate DOGE, the nongovernmental entity. Trump proposed creating a government efficiency commission as part of his economic plans unveiled in September, claiming it could save trillions by eliminating fraud and improper payments within six months.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Defense Deparment, at the Russell Senate Office Building in Washington, DC, on November 21, 2024.\n\nTierney L. Cross/The New York Times/Redux\n\n\n\n\nkfile\nHegseth has a history of supporting controversial policies involving the military\n\n\n\n\n            Trumpâs statement last month announcing the creation of DOGE quoted Musk as saying that âthis will send shockwaves through the system, and anyone involved in Government waste, which is a lot of people!â Ramaswamy separately responded on X with a slogan he often used during his presidential campaign to call for the elimination of federal agencies, writing: âSHUT IT DOWN.â\n    \n\n            But Ramaswamyâs sharp critiques of Muskâs ties to China, all made within the last two years, have received little attention.

But Muskâs role as the leader of companies with lucrative government contracts has sparked concerns about his potential conflicts of interest.\n    \n\n            Ramaswamyâs own words could be used by critics to question Muskâs role as a government cost-cutter, given how much his own companies have benefited over the years from billions of dollars in government contracts and assistance.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVivek Ramaswamy speaks at the Republican National Convention on July 16, 2024, in Milwaukee.\n\nLeon Neal/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            âBoth Tesla and SpaceX quite likely would not exist as successful businesses if it were not for the use of public funding, either through subsidies, through the electric car industry, or through actual government contracting in the case of SpaceX,â Ramaswamy said in 2022 on a Fox News podcast.\n\n\n            Though Musk, the worldâs richest man, and Ramaswamy, himself a millionaire, are both seen as friends of Big Tech, the two have divergent views when it comes to China. While Musk has recently favored closer ties, Ramaswamy has called for an economic decoupling from China.\n    \n\n            As a presidential candidate in the 2024 GOP primary, Ramaswamy was often critical of US economic ties to China. While he claimed other companies such as Apple and Black Rock were enabling and making political concessions to China, he often singled out Musk for some of his harshest criticism.\n    \n\n            âElon Musk has, I think, demonstrated his willingness to change his political tunes based on the favors that he gets to be able to do business in China,â Ramaswamy added on the 2022 Fox News podcast.\n    \n\n        Examining potential for DOGE partnership\n\n\n            CNNâs KFile reviewed Ramaswamyâs comments on Musk when looking into how the two might operate DOGE, the nongovernmental entity. Trump proposed creating a government efficiency commission as part of his economic plans unveiled in September, claiming it could save trillions by eliminating fraud and improper payments within six months.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Defense Deparment, at the Russell Senate Office Building in Washington, DC, on November 21, 2024.\n\nTierney L.

        "content": "CNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            Can the green shoots of clean energy break through the “brown blockade”?\n    \n\nThe brown blockade is the phrase I’ve used to describe the hardening tendency of the states most deeply integrated into the existing oil and gas economy, as either major producers or consumers of fossil fuels, to support Republican presidential and congressional candidates who are resolutely opposed to federal action to combat climate change.\n    \n\n            Those states moved sharply toward Donald Trump and the GOP in this month’s election. The president-elect won a stunning 26 of the 27 states whose economies are the most reliant on the fossil fuels that produce the carbon emissions driving global climate change. Each of the GOP’s four Senate pickups also came in those higher-carbon states.\n    \n\n            In the campaign, Trump promised to take a wrecking ball to virtually all of President Joe Biden’s efforts aimed at reducing carbon emissions and accelerating the shift from fossil fuels to lower-carbon alternatives. The critical role that the states most tightly bound into the existing fossil fuel economy played in both Trump’s victory and the GOP’s success in recapturing the Senate, will only encourage him in that direction.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nIt’s not just Democrats — Republicans are working to Trump-proof their climate money\n\n\n\n\n            The only dynamic that might complicate that offensive, even at the margins, may be the green shoots sprouting across large swathes of red America. This torrent of new investments in wind and solar power, the semiconductors used in clean energy, and especially electric vehicles and their batteries – triggered by the Inflation Reduction Act and other economic development bills signed by Biden – has flowed disproportionately into Republican-held states and congressional districts.\n    \n\n            Those huge current and planned investments in new manufacturing plants may represent the sole opportunity to preserve any elements of Biden’s blueprint for growing the domestic clean energy industry.\n    \n\n            “The beauty of the Inflation Reduction Act is that there is a built-in defense system,” said Lori Lodes, executive director of Climate Power, an environmental advocacy group. “To pull a quote from the ’90s, ‘It’s the economy, stupid.’ There’s hundreds of thousands of new jobs that have been created. Manufacturing is back in the United States. There’s nothing ideological about those jobs. Many of those clean energy workers voted for Trump, I have no doubt.”\n    \n\n        The relationship between fossil fuels and red states\n\n\nAs I’ve written before, the broadest measure of states’ integration into the fossil fuel economy is the analysis by the federal Energy Information Administration of how much carbon each state emits in its energy consumption for each dollar of economic output that it produces. The top of that list is centered on two groups of states. One consists of the large producers of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas (including Wyoming, Louisiana, North Dakota, West Virginia, Alaska, Montana, Oklahoma and Texas); the other big group is states that are large consumers of fossil fuels because they have either robust agricultural sectors (such as Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas) or big manufacturing industries (such as Ohio, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin). Whether as consumers or producers, the high-carbon states are predominantly located in the center of the country.\n    \n\n            The states that emit the least carbon per dollar of economic output are mostly coastal states that produce little oil, gas or coal and have transitioned more rapidly into the post-industrial economy of services and high-tech jobs, such as Massachusetts, New York, Virginia, Maryland, Washington, Oregon and California (which does produce some natural gas).\n    \n\n            Throughout the 21st century, the high-carbon states have become the foundation of the GOP’s geographical strength in both the Senate and the Electoral College. The Republican dominance of those states dramatically solidified in 2024.\n    \n\n            After the 2024 election, Republicans now hold 37 of the 40 Senate seats in the 20 states that emit the most carbon per dollar of economic activity, per the Energy Information Administration. That’s up substantially from the GOP’s control of 32 of the 40 seats from the highest-emitting states after Trump’s first election in 2016.\n    \n\n            Three of the Senate seats Republicans this year flipped from Democratic control rank in the top 20 highest-emitting states: West Virginia, Montana and Ohio, all of which have trended sharply toward the GOP over roughly the past 15 years. The fourth Democratic-held Senate seat Republicans captured was in the battleground of Pennsylvania, which ranks 27th in emissions per dollar of output, just above the national average.\n    \n\n            Across those 27 states with the highest carbon intensity in their economies, Republicans now control 48 of the 54 Senate seats. (The only Democratic senators in those states are two each in New Mexico and Michigan, as well as Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin and John Fetterman in Pennsylvania.)\n    \n\n            The partisan balance is almost inverted in the remaining 23 states with the lowest level of carbon emissions per dollar of output: Democrats hold 41 of those 46 Senate seats, and Republicans just five. The two parties thus present an almost mirror image across this carbon divide: Ninety-one percent of all Republican senators come from the high-carbon states, while 87% of Democratic senators are elected by the lower-carbon states.\n    \n\n            The presidential race tells the same story. Among the 27 states with the highest level of carbon emissions per dollar of economic output, Trump lost only New Mexico. That restored the president-elect’s dominance of the high-carbon states to its level in 2016 (when he also won 26 of the 27 highest-emitting states) after Biden held Trump to just 23 of the top 27 states in 2020. The three former “blue wall” Rust Belt states that Trump recaptured in 2024 – Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – all rank among those higher-emitting states.\n    \n\n            As in the Senate, Democrats dominate the lower-emitting states: Kamala Harris won 18 of the 23 on the bottom of the list, including all 11 states with the absolute lowest level of emissions.\n    \n\n            The politics of energy isn’t necessarily the decisive factor in determining the partisan tilt of most of these states. The high-carbon states also usually have other characteristics that lean them toward the GOP. Most, for instance, have fewer racial minorities, immigrants and college-educated information-economy workers than the national average and more evangelical Christians and rural residents. The low-carbon states present the opposite picture on all of those dimensions.\n    \n\n            But whether or not energy policy is the principal cause of the electoral divergence between high- and low-carbon states, the effect is unmistakable. The low-carbon states tend to elect Democrats who back measures to advance the transition to a low-carbon energy supply and combat climate change. The high-carbon states overwhelmingly vote for Republicans who back expanded domestic production of oil and gas and who resolutely oppose federal action to reduce carbon emissions. That nearly indivisible phalanx of Republicans constitutes the “brown blockade” in Washington.\n    \n\n            Campaign contribution trends reinforce this pattern. As the debate over whether to respond to climate change has intensified over the past quarter-century, the oil and gas industry has shifted its giving almost entirely toward Republicans. In 1990, oil and gas interests split their political contributions about 2-to-1 toward the GOP. But in the last few election cycles, the oil industry has directed nearly 9 in 10 of its campaign dollars toward Republicans, according to OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan group that tracks campaign contributions and spending.\n    \n\n            Trump has been especially close to midsize oil companies that remain focused almost entirely on drilling for oil and gas, as opposed to the multinational oil giants, such as ExxonMobil or Chevon, that have diversified more into lower-carbon energy sources. Chris Wright, Trump’s nominee for energy secretary, runs a company focused on fracking for natural gas and has flatly declared, “There is no ‘climate crisis,’” and “the only thing resembling a crisis … is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.”\n    \n\n            These factors virtually ensure Trump will move to undo many Biden policies opposed by the oil and gas industry. Trump, for instance, is likely to quickly begin the process of rescinding regulations the Environmental Protection Agency approved under Biden requiring auto companies and electric utilities to reduce their carbon emissions (by selling more electric vehicles and deploying more clean power, respectively). (Lee Zeldin, Trump’s nominee to run the EPA, has said his priority for “Day 1 and the first 100 days” will be “to roll back regulations.”) And Trump will likely move rapidly to end the Biden administration’s hold on exports of liquified natural gas and to make more public lands, both on- and offshore, available for oil and gas drilling.\n    \n\n        What will Trump do to clean energy?\n\n\n            But while Trump is certain to take wide-ranging steps to boost the oil and gas industry, it’s an open question how far he will go to also hobble its competitors in the emerging clean energy space.\n    \n\n            Revoking the Biden EPA regulations for clean cars and electricity will hurt alternative energy producers by reducing demand. But, experts agree, the biggest blow Trump could strike against the growing clean energy industries would be to repeal the interconnected tax incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act that promote both the production and consumption of low-carbon alternatives.\n    \n\n            As Congress considers the future of those incentives, the growing importance of clean energy industries in Republican-leaning states and congressional districts could complicate the political equation for GOP lawmakers, even those who represent high-carbon states.\n    \n\nAn exclusive recent CNN analysis of data from the nonpartisan Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for instance, found that nearly four-fifths of the $243 billion in clean energy projects that are either completed or under construction are sited in GOP-held congressional districts. Republican districts are slated to receive an equally large share of another $435 billion in clean energy projects that have been announced but not yet built, the analysis found.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA solar farm built by Rosendin Electric is seen on August 14, 2024, in Liverpool, Texas.\n\nElizabeth Conley/Houston Chronicle/Getty Images\n\n\n\nIn another recent analysis, Climate Power found Trump won 9 of the 10 states that since passage of the IRA have received the most new investment in manufacturing facilities for clean energy and semiconductors associated with those projects. (New York was the only exception.) Trump also won 7 of the 10 states that have seen the most new jobs created in those sectors since passage of the IRA, the analysis found. Eight of the states that rank in the top 10 for either new clean energy jobs or investment are also among the top 25 states that now emit the most carbon.\n    \n\n            If Trump and Congress repeal the IRA tax credits, “I would expect to see announced manufacturing facilities – which are disproportionately [located] in Republican districts –fold up,” said Jason Walsh, executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, a group that works to unite environmentalists and labor unions. “These are not manufacturers who have economies of scale producing in this country yet. The idea was to give them a glide path with multiyear tax incentives, via the IRA. If that goes away, I think many of those facilities, if not most of them, go away.”\n    \n\n            Lodes noted that not only are most of the new clean energy investments flowing into red states, but research shows that the new manufacturing plants are disproportionately sitting in economically distressed exurban and rural communities within those states. “Are they really going to want to turn their backs on communities in their states that have been brought back?” she asked. Moreover, she noted, given that Trump has committed to reducing Americans’ energy costs, will he and GOP legislators “want to take energy off the board, which will just increase people’s cost,” by revoking the IRA subsidies triggering the clean energy manufacturing boom?\n    \n\n            Robert McNally, a Republican energy consultant who served as a White House adviser to President George W. Bush, believes the answer to Lodes’ question will be a simple yes. He’s dubious GOP legislators will fight to preserve many of the new IRA provisions beyond those benefiting a few energy options Republicans favor, such as nuclear power and carbon capture. Republicans, he believe, will also likely try to preserve some longer-standing incentives, like federal support for ethanol production.\n    \n\n            Beyond that, though, the sweeping new IRA incentives for producers and consumers of electric vehicles and solar and wind “just don’t have deep roots,” among Republicans, McNally said. The idea that auto companies “are building battery factories in, say, Georgia so therefore [Republicans from Georgia] will fight repeal of the IRA incentives – I don’t see any sign of that.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Hyundai electric vehicle assembly and battery plant under construction in Ellabell, Georgia, September 9, 2023.\n\nBloomberg/Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\n\n\n            Certainly Republicans have shown nothing but skepticism about the IRA so far. No Republican in either the House or Senate voted for the law when it passed Congress in 2022. After the GOP recaptured the House in 2023, every Republican representative voted to repeal it – even those whose districts were among the biggest beneficiaries of the new clean energy jobs and investments tied to the law.\n    \n\n            Still, environmentalists took heart from a letter 18 Republican House members released in August expressing opposition to repealing the IRA’s incentives for building new manufacturing plants – what they considered to be the first sign that the new jobs and investments might be softening ideological resistance to the law.\n    \n\n            Walsh said that in a stand-alone vote on the IRA’s future, enough House Republicans might resist full repeal to protect the law – especially given the GOP’s narrow majority.\n    \n\n            “The challenge we’re facing is Trump and the GOP leadership in Congress is not going to present members with a simple up or down vote,” Walsh said. Instead, he predicts, the administration will push to repeal key IRA provisions to partly offset the cost for “the trillions of dollars in tax cuts that is the highest priority for Trump and the GOP to pass. So in that context, which I’m sure is the context we will face, the pressure on Republican lawmakers to redistribute money up to the wealthiest Americans is going to be enormous. And that will make the fight a hell of a lot harder.”\n    \n\n            No matter what happens to the IRA, experts agree that EVs and low-carbon power sources such as wind and solar will continue to expand their foothold because of technological advances and economic efficiencies.\n    \n\n            “Electric vehicles are not Betamax,” said University of California at Berkeley economist Joseph Shapiro, referring to a 1980s technology for recording television programs that was eclipsed by rival products. “This is not a technology that if it doesn’t get a big (government) push it won’t be adopted.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFILE - California Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks during a press conference in Los Angeles, Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Thayer, File)\n\nEric Thayer/AP\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nCalifornia could keep the $7,500 EV credit alive if Trump kills the cost-saving measure, Newsom says\n\n\n\n\n            Still, Shapiro and others agree that government policy can enormously influence the pace of the transition from fossil fuels. In a recent paper, he and several colleagues calculated that repealing the IRA’s $7,500 tax credit for purchasing a new electric vehicle, as Trump has pledged to do, would reduce the sales of new EVs by 27%. Domestically assembled EVs would suffer an even greater 37% decline, they forecast, because of the law’s provisions benefiting vehicles built in the US.\n    \n\n            That’s only one example of how the energy decisions made over the next four years could reverberate for decades. The US reliance on the fossil fuels driving climate change has been declining for years, but only at a modest pace. In 2000, fossil fuels provided 88% of the nation’s energy, according to the Energy Information Administration; in 2023, the latest year for which figures are available, that number was 82.5%.\n    \n\n            Biden’s agenda would unquestionably accelerate that change: The Rhodium Group has projected that if current policies remain in place, carbon-free sources within the next decade would provide three-fourths of the nation’s electricity, while electric vehicles would comprise two-thirds to three-fourths of new car sales. In all, the group forecasts that under Biden’s policies, fossil fuels over the next decade would fall to anywhere from 75% to as little as 58% of the nation’s energy mix, according to Ben King, an associate director of Rhodium’s climate and energy practice. That’s a much faster pace of decline than in the past quarter-century.\n    \n\n            Even in that world, King notes, oil and gas producers are hardly facing an existential threat to their business in any medium-term time frame. “It is a more gradual energy transition than people initially think,” King said.\n    \n\n            Yet interrupting that transition by repealing the federal policies benefiting clean energy remains a dangerous gamble. The result could be a vicious downward cycle: less investment in lower-carbon energy alternatives, which means less production, which yields fewer gains from advances in technology and manufacturing efficiency, which means less adoption, which translates into further reductions in clean energy investment and more years with fossil fuels entrenched as the nation’s predominant energy source.\n    \n\n            All of that, in turn, would ensure years of greater carbon emissions – with ominous implications for extreme weather and other manifestations of climate change.\n    \n\n            “If the world adopts EVs in 2060 rather than 2020, it makes a giant difference for the planet because there is 40 years of burning gasoline rather than using a cleaner grid,” Shapiro said. “So the pace of adoption matters even if we end up at the same place in the end.”\n    \n\n            The brown blockade in Washington can’t entirely stop the shift from fossil fuels to a low-carbon energy future – but, as the first months of Trump’s second term may quickly demonstrate, it can significantly slow the change, and raise the cost of delay.",

        "content": "CNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            Can the green shoots of clean energy break through the “brown blockade”?\n    \n\nThe brown blockade is the phrase I’ve used to describe the hardening tendency of the states most deeply integrated into the existing oil and gas economy, as either major producers or consumers of fossil fuels, to support Republican presidential and congressional candidates who are resolutely opposed to federal action to combat climate change.\n    \n\n            Those states moved sharply toward Donald Trump and the GOP in this month’s election. The president-elect won a stunning 26 of the 27 states whose economies are the most reliant on the fossil fuels that produce the carbon emissions driving global climate change. Each of the GOP’s four Senate pickups also came in those higher-carbon states.\n    \n\n            In the campaign, Trump promised to take a wrecking ball to virtually all of President Joe Biden’s efforts aimed at reducing carbon emissions and accelerating the shift from fossil fuels to lower-carbon alternatives. The critical role that the states most tightly bound into the existing fossil fuel economy played in both Trump’s victory and the GOP’s success in recapturing the Senate, will only encourage him in that direction.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nIt’s not just Democrats — Republicans are working to Trump-proof their climate money\n\n\n\n\n            The only dynamic that might complicate that offensive, even at the margins, may be the green shoots sprouting across large swathes of red America. This torrent of new investments in wind and solar power, the semiconductors used in clean energy, and especially electric vehicles and their batteries – triggered by the Inflation Reduction Act and other economic development bills signed by Biden – has flowed disproportionately into Republican-held states and congressional districts.\n    \n\n            Those huge current and planned investments in new manufacturing plants may represent the sole opportunity to preserve any elements of Biden’s blueprint for growing the domestic clean energy industry.\n    \n\n            “The beauty of the Inflation Reduction Act is that there is a built-in defense system,” said Lori Lodes, executive director of Climate Power, an environmental advocacy group. “To pull a quote from the ’90s, ‘It’s the economy, stupid.’ There’s hundreds of thousands of new jobs that have been created. Manufacturing is back in the United States. There’s nothing ideological about those jobs. Many of those clean energy workers voted for Trump, I have no doubt.”\n    \n\n        The relationship between fossil fuels and red states\n\n\nAs I’ve written before, the broadest measure of states’ integration into the fossil fuel economy is the analysis by the federal Energy Information Administration of how much carbon each state emits in its energy consumption for each dollar of economic output that it produces. The top of that list is centered on two groups of states. One consists of the large producers of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas (including Wyoming, Louisiana, North Dakota, West Virginia, Alaska, Montana, Oklahoma and Texas); the other big group is states that are large consumers of fossil fuels because they have either robust agricultural sectors (such as Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas) or big manufacturing industries (such as Ohio, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin). Whether as consumers or producers, the high-carbon states are predominantly located in the center of the country.\n    \n\n            The states that emit the least carbon per dollar of economic output are mostly coastal states that produce little oil, gas or coal and have transitioned more rapidly into the post-industrial economy of services and high-tech jobs, such as Massachusetts, New York, Virginia, Maryland, Washington, Oregon and California (which does produce some natural gas).\n    \n\n            Throughout the 21st century, the high-carbon states have become the foundation of the GOP’s geographical strength in both the Senate and the Electoral College. The Republican dominance of those states dramatically solidified in 2024.\n    \n\n            After the 2024 election, Republicans now hold 37 of the 40 Senate seats in the 20 states that emit the most carbon per dollar of economic activity, per the Energy Information Administration. That’s up substantially from the GOP’s control of 32 of the 40 seats from the highest-emitting states after Trump’s first election in 2016.\n    \n\n            Three of the Senate seats Republicans this year flipped from Democratic control rank in the top 20 highest-emitting states: West Virginia, Montana and Ohio, all of which have trended sharply toward the GOP over roughly the past 15 years. The fourth Democratic-held Senate seat Republicans captured was in the battleground of Pennsylvania, which ranks 27th in emissions per dollar of output, just above the national average.\n    \n\n            Across those 27 states with the highest carbon intensity in their economies, Republicans now control 48 of the 54 Senate seats. (The only Democratic senators in those states are two each in New Mexico and Michigan, as well as Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin and John Fetterman in Pennsylvania.)\n    \n\n            The partisan balance is almost inverted in the remaining 23 states with the lowest level of carbon emissions per dollar of output: Democrats hold 41 of those 46 Senate seats, and Republicans just five. The two parties thus present an almost mirror image across this carbon divide: Ninety-one percent of all Republican senators come from the high-carbon states, while 87% of Democratic senators are elected by the lower-carbon states.\n    \n\n            The presidential race tells the same story. Among the 27 states with the highest level of carbon emissions per dollar of economic output, Trump lost only New Mexico. That restored the president-elect’s dominance of the high-carbon states to its level in 2016 (when he also won 26 of the 27 highest-emitting states) after Biden held Trump to just 23 of the top 27 states in 2020. The three former “blue wall” Rust Belt states that Trump recaptured in 2024 – Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – all rank among those higher-emitting states.\n    \n\n            As in the Senate, Democrats dominate the lower-emitting states: Kamala Harris won 18 of the 23 on the bottom of the list, including all 11 states with the absolute lowest level of emissions.\n    \n\n            The politics of energy isn’t necessarily the decisive factor in determining the partisan tilt of most of these states. The high-carbon states also usually have other characteristics that lean them toward the GOP. Most, for instance, have fewer racial minorities, immigrants and college-educated information-economy workers than the national average and more evangelical Christians and rural residents. The low-carbon states present the opposite picture on all of those dimensions.\n    \n\n            But whether or not energy policy is the principal cause of the electoral divergence between high- and low-carbon states, the effect is unmistakable. The low-carbon states tend to elect Democrats who back measures to advance the transition to a low-carbon energy supply and combat climate change. The high-carbon states overwhelmingly vote for Republicans who back expanded domestic production of oil and gas and who resolutely oppose federal action to reduce carbon emissions. That nearly indivisible phalanx of Republicans constitutes the “brown blockade” in Washington.\n    \n\n            Campaign contribution trends reinforce this pattern. As the debate over whether to respond to climate change has intensified over the past quarter-century, the oil and gas industry has shifted its giving almost entirely toward Republicans. In 1990, oil and gas interests split their political contributions about 2-to-1 toward the GOP. But in the last few election cycles, the oil industry has directed nearly 9 in 10 of its campaign dollars toward Republicans, according to OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan group that tracks campaign contributions and spending.\n    \n\n            Trump has been especially close to midsize oil companies that remain focused almost entirely on drilling for oil and gas, as opposed to the multinational oil giants, such as ExxonMobil or Chevon, that have diversified more into lower-carbon energy sources. Chris Wright, Trump’s nominee for energy secretary, runs a company focused on fracking for natural gas and has flatly declared, “There is no ‘climate crisis,’” and “the only thing resembling a crisis … is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.”\n    \n\n            These factors virtually ensure Trump will move to undo many Biden policies opposed by the oil and gas industry. Trump, for instance, is likely to quickly begin the process of rescinding regulations the Environmental Protection Agency approved under Biden requiring auto companies and electric utilities to reduce their carbon emissions (by selling more electric vehicles and deploying more clean power, respectively). (Lee Zeldin, Trump’s nominee to run the EPA, has said his priority for “Day 1 and the first 100 days” will be “to roll back regulations.”) And Trump will likely move rapidly to end the Biden administration’s hold on exports of liquified natural gas and to make more public lands, both on- and offshore, available for oil and gas drilling.\n    \n\n        What will Trump do to clean energy?\n\n\n            But while Trump is certain to take wide-ranging steps to boost the oil and gas industry, it’s an open question how far he will go to also hobble its competitors in the emerging clean energy space.\n    \n\n            Revoking the Biden EPA regulations for clean cars and electricity will hurt alternative energy producers by reducing demand. But, experts agree, the biggest blow Trump could strike against the growing clean energy industries would be to repeal the interconnected tax incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act that promote both the production and consumption of low-carbon alternatives.\n    \n\n            As Congress considers the future of those incentives, the growing importance of clean energy industries in Republican-leaning states and congressional districts could complicate the political equation for GOP lawmakers, even those who represent high-carbon states.\n    \n\nAn exclusive recent CNN analysis of data from the nonpartisan Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for instance, found that nearly four-fifths of the $243 billion in clean energy projects that are either completed or under construction are sited in GOP-held congressional districts. Republican districts are slated to receive an equally large share of another $435 billion in clean energy projects that have been announced but not yet built, the analysis found.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA solar farm built by Rosendin Electric is seen on August 14, 2024, in Liverpool, Texas.\n\nElizabeth Conley/Houston Chronicle/Getty Images\n\n\n\nIn another recent analysis, Climate Power found Trump won 9 of the 10 states that since passage of the IRA have received the most new investment in manufacturing facilities for clean energy and semiconductors associated with those projects. (New York was the only exception.) Trump also won 7 of the 10 states that have seen the most new jobs created in those sectors since passage of the IRA, the analysis found. Eight of the states that rank in the top 10 for either new clean energy jobs or investment are also among the top 25 states that now emit the most carbon.\n    \n\n            If Trump and Congress repeal the IRA tax credits, “I would expect to see announced manufacturing facilities – which are disproportionately [located] in Republican districts –fold up,” said Jason Walsh, executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, a group that works to unite environmentalists and labor unions. “These are not manufacturers who have economies of scale producing in this country yet. The idea was to give them a glide path with multiyear tax incentives, via the IRA. If that goes away, I think many of those facilities, if not most of them, go away.”\n    \n\n            Lodes noted that not only are most of the new clean energy investments flowing into red states, but research shows that the new manufacturing plants are disproportionately sitting in economically distressed exurban and rural communities within those states. “Are they really going to want to turn their backs on communities in their states that have been brought back?” she asked. Moreover, she noted, given that Trump has committed to reducing Americans’ energy costs, will he and GOP legislators “want to take energy off the board, which will just increase people’s cost,” by revoking the IRA subsidies triggering the clean energy manufacturing boom?\n    \n\n            Robert McNally, a Republican energy consultant who served as a White House adviser to President George W. Bush, believes the answer to Lodes’ question will be a simple yes. He’s dubious GOP legislators will fight to preserve many of the new IRA provisions beyond those benefiting a few energy options Republicans favor, such as nuclear power and carbon capture. Republicans, he believe, will also likely try to preserve some longer-standing incentives, like federal support for ethanol production.\n    \n\n            Beyond that, though, the sweeping new IRA incentives for producers and consumers of electric vehicles and solar and wind “just don’t have deep roots,” among Republicans, McNally said. The idea that auto companies “are building battery factories in, say, Georgia so therefore [Republicans from Georgia] will fight repeal of the IRA incentives – I don’t see any sign of that.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Hyundai electric vehicle assembly and battery plant under construction in Ellabell, Georgia, September 9, 2023.\n\nBloomberg/Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\n\n\n            Certainly Republicans have shown nothing but skepticism about the IRA so far. No Republican in either the House or Senate voted for the law when it passed Congress in 2022. After the GOP recaptured the House in 2023, every Republican representative voted to repeal it – even those whose districts were among the biggest beneficiaries of the new clean energy jobs and investments tied to the law.\n    \n\n            Still, environmentalists took heart from a letter 18 Republican House members released in August expressing opposition to repealing the IRA’s incentives for building new manufacturing plants – what they considered to be the first sign that the new jobs and investments might be softening ideological resistance to the law.\n    \n\n            Walsh said that in a stand-alone vote on the IRA’s future, enough House Republicans might resist full repeal to protect the law – especially given the GOP’s narrow majority.\n    \n\n            “The challenge we’re facing is Trump and the GOP leadership in Congress is not going to present members with a simple up or down vote,” Walsh said.

And that will make the fight a hell of a lot harder.”\n    \n\n            No matter what happens to the IRA, experts agree that EVs and low-carbon power sources such as wind and solar will continue to expand their foothold because of technological advances and economic efficiencies.\n    \n\n            “Electric vehicles are not Betamax,” said University of California at Berkeley economist Joseph Shapiro, referring to a 1980s technology for recording television programs that was eclipsed by rival products. “This is not a technology that if it doesn’t get a big (government) push it won’t be adopted.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFILE - California Gov.

His compatriot Jelani Watkins and Thai sprinter Puripol Boonson occupy second and third place, having each run 10.02 in 2021 and 2023, respectively.\n    \n\n            Later on Friday, once the tailwind had dropped, Gout ran a legal 10.17 in the final – the sixth-fastest legal under-18 time – to beat his personal best of 10.29 and the previous Australian under-18 record of 10.27 held by Sebastian Sultana.\n    \n\n            “I’ve been chasing this national record for a while now! In the heat, I thought I got it, but it was a crazy tailwind, so I just did the same thing and got the job done,” said Gout afterwards, per Athletics Australia.\n    \n\n            Gout broke onto the scene in 2022 when he ran the 100m in 10.57s as a 14-year-old. The last two years have seen the Australian, who turns 17 in late December, draw comparisons to sprinting great Usain Bolt.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGout Gout has drawn comparisons to a young Usain Bolt.\n\nCameron Spencer/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            He garnered even further attention in August when he clocked in at 20.60s in the 200m at the 2024 World Athletics U20 Championships – 0.01 seconds faster than a 15-year-old Bolt managed in 2002, the record at the time. Gout will run in the 200m event on Saturday in Queensland.\n    \n\n            With an Adidas sponsorship deal secured and high hopes for what he could go on to achieve, Gout is already mixing with sprinting royalty.\n    \n\n            “In January, I’m going overseas to train with Noah Lyles and his coach Lance Brauman. Hopefully, we can qualify for the Tokyo World Championships,” he said after Friday’s final. “If not, I’ll just finish my school in Year 12.”",

Van Dyke is in top form in the project – dancing barefoot, singing alongside Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, and even performing some physical comedy.\n    \n\n            Filmed at Van Dyke’s Malibu, California home, the video is interspersed with old photographs and props from the beloved entertainer’s seven-decade career, including publicity stills alongside Mary Tyler Moore for “The Dick Van Dyke Show” and one of his four Primetime Emmy statuettes.\n    \n\n            At one point, Van Dyke remarks that his favorite lyrics in “All My Love” – off of Coldplay’s tenth studio album “Moon Music” – are “Until I die, let me hold you if you cry.” In an interview, he shares, “I’m acutely aware that I could go any day now, but I don’t know why, it doesn’t concern me, I’m not afraid of it. I have that feeling, totally against anything intellectual, that I’m going to be alright.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDick Van Dyke and Arlene Silver.\n\nAtlantic Music Group\n\n\n\n            Van Dyke is then seen on the dance floor alongside his wife, makeup artist Arlene Silver, as they engage in choreography while wearing matching bowler hats before the rest of his “big family” join them for picture-taking and camaraderie.\n    \n\n            The funnyman also displays that he still has his sharp sense of humor, when the interviewer asks him to close his eyes and think about all the people that have meant something to him over the course of his life. After a beat with his eyes closed, Van Dyke says, “I’m too old for this, I’ll pass out and go to sleep” as he play-acts nodding off in his chair.\n    \n\n            Elsewhere, the “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang” actor holds a bunch of red balloons and pretends, quite convincingly for a moment, to float away.\n    \n\n            “I think I’m one of those lucky people who got to do for a living what I would have done anyway,” Van Dyke remarks in the clip, as scenes from his screen career play. “When you think how lucky I am – I got to do what I do, play and act silly.”\n    \n\n            A shorter version of the music video will be released on Friday, December 13, to mark the occasion of Van Dyke’s 99th birthday.",

        "content": "Paris\nCNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            France’s largest musical instrument is ready to sound again.\n    \n\n            It has taken months of painstaking cleaning and decontaminating of 8,000 pipes, 115 organ stops and numerous other musical components, but on Saturday the majestic tones of the Grand Organ of Notre Dame will ring out once more.\n    \n\n            It will be the first time the revived instrument has been played in front of an audience since the Parisian landmark went up in flames more than five years ago.\n    \n\n            Like the Virgin Mary statue that emerged from the blaze miraculously unscathed, the organ somehow managed to avoid significant damage in the April 2019 fire. It was structurally intact, but remnants of the collapsed lead roof filled its cavernous pipes and the cracks between its keys.\n    \n\n            That thick, yellow powder posed no threat to the instrument’s machinery, but the dust needed to be removed for another reason: it was toxic to humans.\n    \n\n            So, as with countless other centuries-old relics and architectural elements inside the cathedral, highly specialized craftspeople were required to get the organ back to its pre-fire form, or as close to it as possible.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetals expert Aurelia Azema displays traces on the metal pipes of the Notre Dame cathedral organ to measure a kind of lead \"fingerprint\" at Champs-sur-Marne, west of Paris ahead of restoration.\n\nFrancois Mori/AP\n\n\n\n            Veteran organ builder Laurent Mesme’s company, Orgues Quoirin, was one of three workshops chosen from across France to restore the Grand Organ.\n    \n\n            Mesme described the process as “incredible.”\n    \n\n            “It was an exceptional worksite. Usually, the organ builder starts to work when everything is done,” he said. “Here, we had to work with the masons, the painters and all the other professionals on site.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPSHOT - This photograph shows the nave, the western Rose window and the organ of Notre-Dame de Paris cathedral in Paris, on November 29, 2024. The Notre-Dame Cathedral is set to re-open early December 2024, with a planned weekend of ceremonies on December 7 and 8, 2024, five years after the 2019 fire which ravaged the world heritage landmark and toppled its spire. Some 250 companies and hundreds of experts were mobilised for the five-year restoration costing hundreds of millions of euros. (Photo by STEPHANE DE SAKUTIN / POOL / AFP) (Photo by STEPHANE DE SAKUTIN/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nStephane de Sakutin/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nNotre Dame is back – but not quite as you knew her\n\n\n\n\n            The restoration process involved more than 30 artisans who spent months dismantling the organ and restoring its electrical and mechanical components before the deep-clean. They were among more than 2,000 craftspeople in total to be involved in the cathedral’s restoration, many using traditional methods from generations ago, according to President Emmanuel Macron’s office.\n    \n\n            Tuning the organ took another six months.\n    \n\n            “This kind of maintenance, where you dismantle the entire organ, usually happens every 50 or 100 years,” Mesme said. “The next restoration isn’t going to happen any time soon.”\n    \n\n            To tune an organ, one needs a perfect ear and, typically, complete silence, the latter of which proved nearly impossible to find on the highly specialized construction site.\n    \n\n            To accommodate this, one team started tuning the pipes by day, while another team perfected the work through the night after construction teams had left.\n    \n\n            These nocturnal artisans were assisted by the four organists of Notre Dame, each of whom was intimately acquainted with the unique character of the organ’s sound from years spent playing the instrument.\n    \n\n            “It wasn’t possible any other way,” said organist Olivier Latry. “During the day it was impossible to do anything (with the noise).”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA file photograph from 2004 shows Notre Dame's organ.\n\nStephane de Sakutin/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            Latry had, in his words, lived with the organ “day and night” since joining the cathedral in 1985. He said it felt strange to spend so much time away from it after the fire.\n    \n\n            “It’s really a very intimate bond that’s been established. And it’s funny, the fact that the organ has been out of commission for five years and we find it again, it’s a bit like finding an old friend we haven’t seen for a few years,” he told CNN.\n    \n\n            Thanks to this collaboration between artisan and musician, the sound of the organ has been restored to exactly as it was before the fire, though it remains to be seen if the acoustics of the cathedral will match once the new furniture is added.\n    \n\n            Latry and Notre Dame’s three other organists are set to play when the cathedral hosts its reopening ceremony on Saturday. The music for what organizers have dubbed the “grand awakening” of the organ will be improvised by the musician based on the emotion of the historic moment, according to Latry.\n    \n\n            When they finally play, the artisans who restored the organ will have etched their own unique mark onto a piece of French history.\n    \n\n            “Every time there has been a restoration, the organ builders have preserved what the previous organ builders have done. As a result, the organ is not the work of a single builder. It’s really a shared work that unfolds over three or four centuries,” Latry said.\n    \n\n            “It’s a bit like this organ is the history of France,” he added.",

        "content": "CNN\n         — \n    \n\n\nLeBron James making a buzzer-beater to win the game. Patrick Mahomes scanning the field with seconds remaining. Lionel Messi standing over a free kick in stoppage time.\n    \n\n            Most team sports allow their biggest stars to take over in the most important moments – the ones when you just have to get it right.\n    \n\n            Not baseball. It doesn’t matter whether it’s the first inning or the ninth, whether you’re up by 10 or down by one. You could be Aaron Judge or a struggling rookie, but – save for pinch hitters – if you’re up next, you’re up next.\n    \n\n            But, after MLB commissioner Rob Manfred controversially floated the idea of a Golden At-Bat rule in October, all that might be about to change.\n    \n\n        What is a Golden At-Bat?\n\n\n            Manfred’s idea is simple. Once a game, a coach can choose to sit down whoever is on deck, and instead send any batter of his choosing to the plate.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred speaks at a press conference following an owners meeting on May 23.\n\nJulia Nikhinson/AP\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\n‘Why do we want to bastardize our game?’: MLB players and managers join criticism of Golden At-Bat proposal\n\n\n\n\n            It is unclear yet how the details of the proposal – which according to Manfred was “in the conversation-only stage right now” in October – would work.\n    \n\n            Potential wrinkles to the rule could include an option where only the team that is trailing in the ninth inning can use a Golden At-Bat, or where teams can only use it in the seventh inning or later.\n    \n\n            It is also unknown whether there would be any restrictions on who you are allowed to summon to the plate. If, for example, Toronto Blue Jays first baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hits a double, can he then go back to the plate and hit again in a Golden At-Bat? And if he can, who would replace him at second base?\n    \n\n            These are all questions that will have to be answered if the proposal goes any further.\n    \n\n        Will the Golden At-Bat rule definitely be introduced?\n\n\n            In short, no. Given how early in its development the rule is, there is absolutely no guarantee that the concept will move beyond the ideas stage.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor League Baseball (MLB) will test the use of robot umpires as part of a challenge system during spring training next year with the aim of implementing it in the 2026 regular season.\n\nEzra Shaw/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nMLB to test robot umpires as part of challenge system at next Spring training, plans use in 2026 regular season\n\n\n\n\n            However, it is looking more and more likely that the Golden At-Bat will be tested away from the MLB. According to The Athletic, those involved in the minor leagues have heard “buzz” that the league is interested in trialing the rule over the next two years.\n    \n\n            The MLB All-Star Game has also been suggested as a potential testing ground for the rule.\n    \n\n            Speaking on The Varsity with John Ourand, Manfred said: “Most of the changes we have discussed involve producing the matchups, in the context of an exhibition game, that the fans want to see the most. You know, more freedom in terms of substitution and whatnot. I am receptive to those ideas, in the context of an exhibition game.”\n    \n\n            While not speaking specifically about the Golden At-Bat or the All-Star Game, it is not hard to see why many have reached the conclusion that Manfred would like to see the concept play out in the Midsummer Classic.\n    \n\n        Where did the idea originate?\n\n\n            While Manfred has caused quite a stir in mentioning the rule, the idea of a Golden At-Bat has been around for years.\n    \n\n            Former Miami Marlins president David Samson says that he informally pitched the idea a decade ago, when he was a member of MLB’s previous version of its committee.\n    \n\n            “The view was, you are basically ruining the sanctity of the game,” he told The Athletic. “The brilliance of the history of the game is that, hey, if the right guy’s up, the right guy’s up – and if not, he’s not.”\n    \n\n            It should perhaps come as no surprise that the proposal has come back into discussion now. Manfred has developed a reputation as a tinkerer, having introduced the generally popular pitch clock and the generally unpopular ghost runner rule, which automatically places a runner on second base at the start of each extra inning in regular-season games.\n    \n\n        How would it change the game?\n\n\n            The introduction of a Golden At-Bat rule – at least without very strict limitations on how and when teams could use it – would fundamentally change the sport in any number of ways.\n    \n\n            We would likely see a significant boost in the best players’ stats. Players like Shohei Ohtani could potentially have an extra 120 at-bats per season, most of which would come with the opportunity to bring home runners.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen St. Louis Cardinals third baseman David Freese celebrates his game-winning home run in the 11th inning of Game 6 the World Series on October 27, 2011.\n\nJeff Haynes/Reuters\n\n\n\n            It is therefore likely that, pretty quickly, the league would see new records for RBIs, home runs and various other stats.\n    \n\n            Conversely, it would also likely mean a decline in the stats for the league’s relief pitchers, who would suddenly be facing much higher caliber batters far more often.\n    \n\n            As pointed out by Philadelphia Phillies reliever Matt Strahm when speaking to The Athletic, “Say you have a guy like Craig Kimbrel, who is going to be chasing 500 saves. Then he’s got to do it at the end of his career against Aaron Judge and Juan Soto for every save?”\n    \n\n            On top of that, the rule would likely see a reduction in moments when unfancied batters shock the world by pulling a clutch moment out of nowhere.\n    \n\n            David Freese’s game-tying triple for the St. Louis Cardinals in the ninth inning of Game 6 of the 2011 World Series – which he followed up with a walk-off home run – saw him become World Series MVP that year.\n    \n\n            But, given he was 0-for-3 in the game before then, would he really have had the chance to swing the bat if the Cardinals could have swapped him out for star Albert Pujols?\n    \n\n        How have current and former players and managers reacted?\n\n\n            It is “what if?” discussions like these that have driven the largely negative reception that the proposal has received from players and managers.\n    \n\n            “Not all change is great,” wrote former Red Sox first baseman Kevin Youkilis on X. “The best part of baseball is when the guy least expected to get the big hit delivers at the end of the game. A memory that lasts a lifetime for the player and fans.\n    \n\n            “The roller coaster ride of emotions in sports is what makes it the best unscripted entertainment.”\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Boston Red Sox first baseman Kevin Youkilis is one of a number of players, past and present, to voice their opposition to the rule.\n\nGregory Shamus/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            “Our game is not built that way,” Joe Maddon – former manager of the Tampa Bay Rays, Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Angels – told The Athletic. “Why do we want to bastardize our game and make it like everybody else?\n    \n\n            “The more we see things, the less impact they have,” he continued. “The Trout-Ohtani thing (the final at-bat in the 2023 WBC Championship) was outstanding because you rarely see it. You don’t see Halley’s Comet every night.”\n    \n\n            That might very well be true, but one thing is for sure – if the Golden At-Bat rule does come into effect, you might not be seeing more comets in the sky. But you will be seeing a lot more of the stars on the field.",

They also compared it to other omnivores and carnivores, finding that her diet was most similar to a scimitar cat that primarily hunted mammoths.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTodd Surovell\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nArchaeologists discover key tool that helped early Americans survive the ice age\n\n\n\n\n            For Shane Doyle, executive director of Yellowstone Peoples, who liaised with Native American tribes throughout the study, the findings illustrate “how amazing (the Clovis people) really were.”\n    \n\n            “They were skilled, but they were determined, and they were some of the most resilient people that have ever been on this planet,” Doyle said in a press briefing.\n    \n\n            By hunting mammoths, it is possible that humans helped hasten the animal’s extinction.\n    \n\n            “The largest mammoth sites in the USA and Central Europe contain the remains of mainly younger animals… possibly the easiest to kill,” Haynes said. “The removal of this generation of animals in North America during a period of critical climate change could have been the main factor that led to mammoth extinction.”\n    \n\n            The study was published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.",

        "content": "CNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            Messing up pronunciations can be a source of both annoyance and amusement, but language learning platform Babbel has put together a handy guide to stop you putting your foot in it.\n    \n\n            The company published a list of the most mispronounced words of the year in the United States and the United Kingdom on Wednesday, including foreign words that have entered the English lexicon for one reason or another, as well as the names of various politicians and public figures.\n    \n\n            US Vice President Kamala Harris is one prominent entry, with her first name the source of plenty of confusion. It should be pronounced COM-a-la, according to Babbel.\n    \n\n            One name that features on both the US and UK lists is award-winning Irish actor Barry Keoghan. “His name is pronounced (key-OH-gin), with a clear “g,” unlike many Irish variations where the “g” would be silent,” said Babbel.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's Barry key-OH-gin.\n\nMichael Tran/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            Another dual entry is fast-fashion firm Shein. Founded in China, the company has grown massively. If you’re discussing potential purchases, or reports that the company plans to list on the London Stock Exchange, remember that the name should be pronounced (SHE-in) rather than (SHEEN).\n\n\n            Other notable entrants include semaglutide, an active ingredient in weight loss drug Ozempic, pronounced (sem-ah-GLOO-tide); rising music star Chappell Roan (CHAP-uhl ROHN); and US actress Zendaya (zen-DAY-uh).\n    \n\n            The Swedish language also contributes two words on the UK list: smokeless tobacco Snus, pronounced (SNOOZ), and flygskam, the name of a movement that aims to discourage people from flying that should be pronounced (FLEEG-skam).\n    \n\n            Italian readers will also appreciate the inclusion of the word espresso on the list.\n    \n\n            While many British people commonly mispronounce it when ordering a small black coffee, crimes against the Italian language spiked this summer when Sabrina Carpenter’s single “Espresso” topped the UK charts.\n    \n\n            Remember, it’s (es-PRESS-oh) not (EX-press-oh).",

        "title": "This year marks the Buffalo Bills’ best chance of a Super Bowl win yet",
        "content": "CNN\n         — \n    \n\n\n            I have been a Buffalo Bills fan for as long as I can remember. I have lived through a nearly 20-year playoff drought – I used to say the Bills haven’t made the playoffs since before my bar mitzvah.\n    \n\n            Now, the Bills are in the midst of a historic run behind future Hall of Fame quarterback Josh Allen, yet they haven’t won a Super Bowl. That’s why every week until they win a Super Bowl in February (as I will it into existence), I’ll be keeping what I call a diary.\n    \n\n            Mostly, this column will be a statistical analysis of why I think they will go all the way, as well as a reference or two to memories past.\n    \n\n        This is the Bills’ best chance of a Super Bowl to date\n\n\n            Let’s start off very simply: the Bills have never had as good of a chance of winning a Super Bowl the last few seasons as they do now.\n    \n\n            I’m not making this up as a homer – this is statistically true. The New York Times playoff simulator gives the Bills a 20% chance of finally raising the Lombardi Trophy as of time of publication. The Bills’ chances have never been higher at this point in the season dating back to when Allen first led the team to the playoffs in 2019.\n    \n\n            On the most basic level, the team is 10-2. No Bills team this century has had a better record through 12 games. They also clinched the AFC East this past week; no franchise has clinched a division title so early since the league expanded the season to 17 games a few years ago.\n    \n\n            Last year, you may recall, the Bills only won the division in the final game of the season down in Miami. They had to claw all the way back from being 6-6 on the campaign.\n    \n\n            The two times the Bills were anywhere close to having a similar record as they do now during the Josh Allen era were 2020 and 2022.\n    \n\n            In 2020, they were 9-3 before winning out the rest of the season. That team though was incredibly lucky. Through 12 games in the season, their point differential – the points they scored vs. gave up – was a mere 27 points. This year, the Bills are outscoring their opponents by 131 points after their 12th game.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBills quarterback Josh Allen runs for a first down against the Chiefs on November 17.\n\nMark Konezny/USA Today Sports/Reuters\n\n\n\n            When the Bills win, they usually win by a lot. Just three of their wins have been by one score (eight points or less). Often, they’re blowing teams out, such as when they crushed the San Francisco 49ers 35-10 last week.\n    \n\n            Their 131-point differential is first in the AFC by 59 points and second in the NFL behind the Super Bowl-contending Detroit Lions.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetroit Lions running back Jahmyr Gibbs, center, celebrates after a touchdown catch against the Green Bay Packers in Detroit, Michigan, on December 5, 2024.\n\nDuane Burleson/AP\n\n\n\ngallery\n          \n\n\nRelated gallery\nThe best photos from the 2024 NFL season\n\n\n\n\n            Now, point differential isn’t everything (case in point, the 2023 Kansas City Chiefs), but it is one of the stats that is most predictive of playoff success.\n    \n\n            Consider that the team that finished second in point differential at the end of the season has gone on to appear in the Super Bowl more than 40% of the time. The team that finished second in point differential has gone on to win the Super Bowl a little less than 30% of the time.\n    \n\n            I think most Bills fans would take a roughly 30% chance of winning the Super Bowl right now.\n    \n\n            Of course, we’ve seen a recent Bills team finish second in point differential and fail to produce: 2022. That 2022 squad was 9-3 then also moved 10-3 – slightly worse than this 2024 team is currently.\n    \n\n            By this point in the season, however, the 2022 team was struggling. After winning their average game by 15 points through October, the best they could manage in the five games leading into Week 14 was averaging a meager four-point win.\n    \n\n            The 2024 team, however, is hitting its stride. The Bills are averaging a 14-point win in their last five games heading into Week 14.\n    \n\n            This 2024 stretch includes two score or more wins over two division leaders: the Chiefs and the Seattle Seahawks.\n    \n\n            The bottom line is that the Bills have looked mighty good. I dare say they make me want to shout and shout (and perhaps, let it all out).\n    \n\n        Favorite play of last week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllen's diving touchdown - while an amazing play - was not the writer's favorite of the past week.\n\nBryan M. Bennett/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            The obvious answer here would be Allen’s receiving touchdown, but that would be too easy.\n    \n\n            Instead, it’s this forced fumble by Taylor Rapp and recovery by Christian Benford.\n    \n\n            Why?\n    \n\n            First off, it demonstrates a “bend, don’t break” defense tremendously. The Bills tighten up near the goalline, even if they allow other teams to get close to the goalline.\n    \n\n            Second, I’m always petrified that the Bills will lose. It was at this moment when I realized the Niners were never going to get within two scores the rest of the ball game.\n    \n\nUnhappy memory incoming…\n\n\n            I’ll keep this short. A few years ago, I, for some reason, agreed to do a late Sunday afternoon television appearance. I thought that the Bills game would be over by then.\n    \n\n            Instead, I had just enough time to see the Bills make a tremendous goalline stand against the Minnesota Vikings. Then, as I was riding the elevator and couldn’t see play, Allen fumbled the ball with under a minute to go at the Bills own goalline.\n    \n\n            If the Bills hadn’t fumbled, they would have just run out the clock by kneeling the ball. Instead, the Vikings eventually won in overtime.\n    \n\n            It is the only game in the last 20 years where a team led with under a minute left, did not need to gain another first down in order to run out the clock… and lost.\n    \n\n            Needless to say, I am hoping that never happens again.",
